1
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:58,480
All right, we're good to go.

2
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:01,680
- You got this?
- You bet your ass, bubba.

3
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:04,239
Let's make some money!

4
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:11,319
Everyone in position.

5
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,198
I thought we'd be
robbing banks by now,

6
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:17,558
not some gas truck
in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:20,897
Down here, gas is gold, bubba.

8
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,518
Kill the chatter! Game time.

9
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,878
I wouldn't piss him off, guys.

10
00:01:55,457 --> 00:01:57,376
Okay, guys, we're gonna
have to hit this hard and fast.

11
00:01:57,377 --> 00:02:00,281
We got four K left
before the downgrade.

12
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,771
Locked and loaded!

13
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,721
This is all you, Han.

14
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:58,081
Liquid gold.

15
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,920
We're clear.

16
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:07,719
Okay, T, you're up.

17
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,918
Let's see if you can get it
under six tries this time, huh, T?

18
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,998
It's more like three.
Come on, Tego, keep it real.

19
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:41,215
Just one K left. We're running
out of road. Get in there, brother.

20
00:03:41,216 --> 00:03:43,654
I got it, I got it.

21
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:53,693
Shit!

22
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:01,452
T, cut loose!
Unhitch, unhitch!

23
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:50,971
Spray that hitch!
I don't have a hammer!

24
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:53,091
Just do it!

25
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,849
Hold on! Hold on!

26
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,969
No shit!

27
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,168
Hold onto something tight!

28
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:39,734
Letty!

29
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,973
Give me your hand!
I can't reach!

30
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,253
You got to jump!

31
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,809
Jump!

32
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,688
Letty, jump!

33
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,568
I've got you!

34
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,508
Dom...

35
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,908
Dom?

36
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:03,947
Dom!

37
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:16,890
How you doing?

38
00:08:17,852 --> 00:08:20,010
Money, money!

39
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:22,411
Good.

40
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:26,170
Yo, why your stack
is bigger than mine always?

41
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,609
I'm supersized, baby.

42
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,728
Cops just raided
our garage in Baracoa.

43
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,808
They were real
interested in you.

44
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:48,447
Heat's on and we just sent up a flare
that's gonna lead them right to us.

45
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:52,086
I say we move out first thing
in the morning.

46
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,638
Nah, it's me they want.

47
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,598
And if they catch me,

48
00:08:58,599 --> 00:09:02,158
they're throwing big numbers
at anybody with me.

49
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:07,077
Han, we had a good run.

50
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:11,636
Time for you to go
do your own thing.

51
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:18,276
Heard they're doing
some crazy shit in Tokyo.

52
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:27,467
Have you seen Letty?

53
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:41,265
There she is.

54
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:49,624
I hear Rio is nice this time of year.

55
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,704
The cops are getting hungrier.

56
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:57,703
Then I guess we're doing our job.

57
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,539
I'm a walking target.

58
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,378
I don't want you around
when they catch up to me.

59
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,777
"Ride or die," remember?

60
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,738
Dom, how long have
we been doing this?

61
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,298
And now all of a sudden,
outta nowhere, it's too dangerous?

62
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:25,417
Come on.

63
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,259
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

64
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:53,316
- I don't know shit!
- Give me a name!

65
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,818
- I don't know shit, man!
- Give me a name!

66
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:06,257
David Park!
David Park's the guy you want!

67
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:08,017
Please!

68
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:20,211
Thank God. Listen, he's in a mood
because yesterday was his cheat day,

69
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,171
and then today, some genius
brought in donuts.

70
00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:24,010
Great.

71
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,210
Sorry I'm late.

72
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:31,610
Complaints keep rolling in after your
little downtown Olympics, O'Conner.

73
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:34,729
Tell me that reinstating you
wasn't a mistake.

74
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,303
- I got a name. David Park.
- That's it?

75
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,654
That's all you got?
David Park?

76
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:43,493
I could throw a fortune cookie out this
window and hit 50 David Parks right now.

77
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:46,693
- It's Korean, not Chinese.
- Whatever.

78
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:51,172
Park is a scout that recruits street racers
to be mules for the Braga cartel.

79
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:54,332
We find Park,
and we bust the bad guys.

80
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:18,969
Dom.

81
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,009
Mia, I told you
not to call me here.

82
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,328
Dom, it's Letty.

83
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:27,009
She's been murdered.

84
00:15:41,368 --> 00:15:45,726
We have gathered here
to pay our final respects to...

85
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:49,445
Let us reflect on her journey...

86
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:57,564
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
not want. He makes me lie down"...

87
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,079
Facial recognition software
matched Toretto...

88
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,518
about 10 minutes after
he crossed the border.

89
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,439
I don't get it.

90
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,917
I thought he'd show.

91
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:29,385
I told you not to come.
They're staking the place out.

92
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:32,423
- If they find you...
- They won't.

93
00:17:34,465 --> 00:17:38,183
Come on.
Look at you.

94
00:18:02,702 --> 00:18:05,740
Letty wouldn't let them junk it.

95
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:09,740
Even though it is a goddamn curse.

96
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:15,259
When she came back,
she was always in here,

97
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:18,659
working on it day and night.

98
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,688
It was weird.

99
00:18:28,569 --> 00:18:32,087
It was like she knew
you were coming back.

100
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:36,287
I wanna see the crash site.

101
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:45,005
I just got off the phone
with Deputy Director Lawson.

102
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:48,366
If we don't make serious inroads into
the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

103
00:18:48,367 --> 00:18:51,205
they're gonna shut us down.

104
00:18:51,646 --> 00:18:54,164
I know I'm a newbie here,
but why the clock now?

105
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:57,492
Because it's been two years,

106
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,972
and the last three agents we sent
to infiltrate his organization...

107
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,332
came back in body bags.

108
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,812
He's moved more heroin across the
border than Escobar did in 10 years.

109
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,572
This guy is becoming one of
our biggest national threats,

110
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,652
and we don't even
have a picture of him.

111
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:15,691
We don't have prints!
Not even a goddamn DOB!

112
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:20,130
What's the status on David Park?

113
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:22,330
Isn't he our ticket into
the Braga organization?

114
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:26,050
We're running the name through city and
county databases, sorting the possibilities.

115
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:27,969
We've got over 500 already.

116
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:32,262
Park's insignificant.
Sounds like another jerk-off to me.

117
00:19:32,263 --> 00:19:36,142
It's not. Without Park, Braga wouldn't
have drivers to move his shipments.

118
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:38,861
Cross-check traffic.
lllegal modifications.

119
00:19:38,862 --> 00:19:43,700
Street racing. This guy will definitely
have a record. We'll find him.

120
00:19:43,822 --> 00:19:45,781
We better.

121
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:47,540
What do you know?

122
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:51,140
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle has
been spotted in his old neighborhood.

123
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:52,939
I'm gonna bring his ass in.

124
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,779
Not in your car you're not.

125
00:20:05,515 --> 00:20:07,993
It's straight ahead.

126
00:22:12,586 --> 00:22:15,505
You found something
back there.

127
00:22:19,545 --> 00:22:22,703
There were burn marks
on the ground.

128
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,783
The kind that could
only be caused by nitrometh.

129
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:35,502
There's only one guy
in all of L.A. that sells that.

130
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:42,420
Nothing you can do
is gonna bring her back, Dom.

131
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:46,020
If I were Letty,
I would ask you...

132
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:50,140
No, I would beg you,
please, let this go.

133
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:54,612
Before it's too late.

134
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,772
It's already too late.

135
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:07,452
I love you.

136
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,530
Miss Toretto.

137
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:19,490
I'm Michael Stasiak, FBI.

138
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:22,649
Let's you and I
have a little chat.

139
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,598
Hi. This is Forsythe in Evidence.

140
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,158
I need Stasiak down here
right away to sign some greenies.

141
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:50,678
Thanks.

142
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:52,238
- Hi.
- Hey.

143
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,797
Okay, I narrowed it down
to 50 or so David Parks.

144
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,650
What I'd like you to do is run the
make and model on each one of them.

145
00:24:58,651 --> 00:24:59,650
- All right?
- Okay. All right.

146
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:01,529
Thank you.

147
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,927
Hey, Tyler, we got a transfer.

148
00:25:15,329 --> 00:25:17,967
You want to come with me?

149
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:41,822
Toretto.

150
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:43,983
When'd you get back in town?

151
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:46,822
I'm looking for a car
you did an engine mod on.

152
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:51,820
Nitromethane tank. Ford full-size.
Continental tires.

153
00:25:52,982 --> 00:25:56,702
Look, what're you doing,
coming in here like this, huh?

154
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:59,342
This ain't your scene
anymore, boss.

155
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:02,021
Don't ever put your hands
on me again, okay?

156
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:04,940
Say hi to your sister for me.

157
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:18,886
- A Korean kid brought it in.
- Who?

158
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:20,546
David Park.

159
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:23,584
It's a green Ford Torino.

160
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:26,784
Please don't drop this on me!

161
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:33,104
I'm almost done.

162
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:38,623
Why don't you tell me why you
dragged me here, Brian?

163
00:26:43,824 --> 00:26:48,222
You know they're going
to capture Dom. Maybe worse.

164
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:53,982
I don't want you getting tangled
up in this. So stay away from him.

165
00:26:54,183 --> 00:26:58,102
That's what you have to say
to me after five years?

166
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:02,140
All of a sudden,
you care what happens to me.

167
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:09,073
What I did to you was wrong.

168
00:27:09,074 --> 00:27:13,872
I'm sorry. It was... It was the
hardest thing I've ever had to do.

169
00:27:14,594 --> 00:27:17,032
I'm sorry, too, Brian.

170
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:21,672
I'm so sorry that you had to come
into my home and pretend to love me.

171
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,031
I'm so sorry that you ripped
my family apart.

172
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,511
I'm very sorry that that was
hard for you.

173
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:32,630
I lied to you.

174
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:36,270
I lied to Dom.
I lied to everybody.

175
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:40,069
That's what I do best.
It's why the Feds recruited me.

176
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:43,948
Maybe you're lying to yourself.

177
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:50,124
Maybe you're not the good guy
pretending to be a bad guy.

178
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:53,444
Maybe you're the bad guy
pretending to be the good guy.

179
00:27:53,445 --> 00:27:56,204
You ever think about that?

180
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:59,204
Every day.

181
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:12,842
I always wondered,

182
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:18,791
why did you let
my brother go that day?

183
00:28:19,553 --> 00:28:21,671
I don't know.

184
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:32,549
Shit.

185
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:36,695
Brian!

186
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:39,694
I got the cross-checks on David Park
back and have a list of possibles.

187
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:42,128
- What'd you got?
- A 45-year-old male in a '06 Scion...

188
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:44,173
- with 3 reckless driving tickets.
- No.

189
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:46,533
- An '01 Chevy Tahoe.
- No.

190
00:28:46,534 --> 00:28:50,292
Two Mini Coopers,
a '06 and a '07, a Toyota hybrid.

191
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,933
- Hell no.
- A '98 Saturn, a '95 Sebring.

192
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,750
A '98 Nissan 240
with an illegal mod.

193
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,750
Wait. That's it.

194
00:28:57,751 --> 00:29:00,270
- What?
- The 240 with the illegal mod.

195
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:04,068
- How'd you know?
- 'Cause that's something I'd drive.

196
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,519
Don't! Don't! Don't!

197
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,278
Green Torino, running nitro.

198
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,198
- Whose car?
- I don't know, man.

199
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:49,677
I'm just the middleman. I swear!
I'm just the middleman!

200
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:55,918
Wait, wait, wait.

201
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,637
I don't know shit, man. I swear.
I just run cars for Braga, all right?

202
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:02,397
All I can do is get you in the race!
That's all I can do!

203
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:04,396
What race?

204
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:12,420
Help! Come on, hold on!

205
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:15,378
Let me up, man!
Come on!

206
00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:28,218
Come on, man,
I don't know shit! Just let me up!

207
00:30:28,219 --> 00:30:30,377
I told you,
you gotta talk to Braga!

208
00:30:30,378 --> 00:30:31,377
Bring him up, Dom.

209
00:30:31,378 --> 00:30:34,656
God! Don't drop me!
That's all I know!

210
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:36,536
Bring him up.

211
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:39,376
You here to take me in, O'Conner?

212
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:42,495
- Shit! Shit!
- Shut up!

213
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:47,847
Letty was my friend, too.

214
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,487
You weren't anyone's friend.

215
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:52,567
Yo, can you guys talk about this later?
Now pull my ass up!

216
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:54,847
She was running for this guy,
Braga, and things went bad.

217
00:30:54,848 --> 00:30:55,927
Please!

218
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:58,527
I'm gonna get these guys, Dom.

219
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:00,726
Now let me do my job
and bring him up.

220
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:03,766
I'm gonna kill this Braga.

221
00:31:04,926 --> 00:31:06,486
God!

222
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:09,805
And anyone else
who gets in my way.

223
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,005
Hey!

224
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,164
Don't let go.

225
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,387
O'Conner!

226
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:33,586
O'Conner! If you ever release
a witness of mine again...

227
00:31:37,106 --> 00:31:39,025
- That's enough!
- Don't touch me.

228
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:40,465
- I'm fine!
- That's enough.

229
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:44,224
- You're through, O'Conner!
- I said that's enough!

230
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:47,279
Stasiak, go get
yourself cleaned up.

231
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,520
What?
He hit me first! You...

232
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:51,520
This isn't the Cub Scouts!

233
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:55,319
Now, go on!
You're bleeding on my floor.

234
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,638
O'Conner, do you know the difference
between a cop and a criminal?

235
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:09,637
- What?
- One bad judgment call.

236
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,157
Keep your shit in line, son.

237
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:20,450
Have a good time.

238
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,929
Take a seat.

239
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:32,529
Good news. We have intel that
Braga's number two, Ramon Campos,

240
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,723
will hold a street race
in Koreatown tomorrow night...

241
00:32:34,724 --> 00:32:37,288
to fill a slot on his team.

242
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,527
They've already chosen 3 drivers
from previous races.

243
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:43,407
Our newest informant,
Mr. David Park,

244
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:46,726
has been kind enough
to get us into the race.

245
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:51,247
O'Conner, you're up.

246
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,463
Let me guess,
winner gets the slot.

247
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,823
All right, so these are all the
imports the city has in impound.

248
00:33:03,824 --> 00:33:05,942
- Okay, nice.
- Pick your poison.

249
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:09,102
All right, 2206.
I crashed one of those.

250
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:14,261
3418 and 2765.

251
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:16,821
Okay, so which one
do you want?

252
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:19,141
I want them all.

253
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,609
Standard issue tracking device.

254
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,129
Boss wants to know
where you are at all times.

255
00:34:42,803 --> 00:34:44,642
You wanna play with it?

256
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:48,911
Hey!

257
00:34:48,912 --> 00:34:51,311
What're you looking at,
nutsack?

258
00:34:51,312 --> 00:34:53,071
I don't know. You tell me.

259
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:55,311
The racer wants what Dwight's got.

260
00:34:55,312 --> 00:34:58,230
See, but, ladies,
Dwight's already on the team.

261
00:34:58,231 --> 00:35:00,190
You gotta be fast
if you wanna drive for Braga.

262
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:03,589
- Is there a problem here?
- No.

263
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,309
You one of Park's guys, blondie?

264
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,429
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

265
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,548
Follow me.

266
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:16,467
See you later, punk.

267
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:18,387
You, too, punk.

268
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,930
Bull's-eye, come, come on!

269
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:40,289
We can do this all day.

270
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:48,089
You all know why you're here.

271
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,208
Good drivers...

272
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,248
are a dime a dozen.

273
00:35:53,249 --> 00:35:58,047
Man, every corner's got a
chingadera tuner racing for pinks.

274
00:35:58,168 --> 00:36:01,607
That's not what Braga
has got me looking for.

275
00:36:01,608 --> 00:36:06,766
Braga wants someone that would sell
their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

276
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:11,606
Someone that drives their 10-second
cars not in a straight line,

277
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:16,325
but to push it and make it through
places no one else would take it.

278
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:20,300
Real drivers.

279
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:24,339
So, what are we hauling?

280
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,979
For the money Braga's paying,
you don't need to know.

281
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,218
You just said you wanted real drivers.

282
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,178
A real driver knows
exactly what's in his car.

283
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:42,738
Mira, real driver,

284
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:46,058
nobody's forcing you to race.

285
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:49,962
You the boss?

286
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:53,841
Or am I talking to the boss?

287
00:36:56,003 --> 00:36:58,520
Do I look like a boss?

288
00:36:58,762 --> 00:36:59,961
Buddy...

289
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:03,440
My job is to find
the best drivers... period.

290
00:37:03,441 --> 00:37:07,640
Whoever wins the race
gets the info. We cool?

291
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,839
Are we cool?

292
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,359
Yeah, we're cool.

293
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,958
No, we ain't cool, man.

294
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:23,563
Who's closing these streets?

295
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,922
No one.
That's the point.

296
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:42,441
<i>Please wait while
directions are downloaded.</i>

297
00:37:48,484 --> 00:37:51,522
Proceed to the highlighted route.

298
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:53,322
Ten,

299
00:37:54,283 --> 00:37:56,121
nine,

300
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:58,841
eight,

301
00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:01,641
seven,

302
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:03,441
six...

303
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:07,280
- You sure you wanna do this?
- A lot has changed.

304
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:09,959
- four...
- You're right.

305
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:11,919
three,

306
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,519
two,

307
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,078
one,

308
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,919
go!

309
00:38:28,652 --> 00:38:30,970
Right turn ahead.

310
00:38:33,491 --> 00:38:37,210
You are now five miles
from your destination.

311
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:03,927
How's my ass look, Chia Pet?

312
00:39:04,048 --> 00:39:06,206
Ghetto Smurf.

313
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:34,533
Dead man driving.

314
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,252
Come on!

315
00:39:39,815 --> 00:39:42,213
Right turn ahead.

316
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:01,531
Oh, shit!

317
00:40:05,932 --> 00:40:07,250
Damn.

318
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,755
Rerouting.

319
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:18,628
Rerouting.

320
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:29,086
Proceed straight ahead.

321
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:34,525
Rerouting.

322
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:45,085
Shit.

323
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,538
- Rerouting.
- Just shut up!

324
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,258
You are 2.6 miles
from destination.

325
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:01,657
Oops, I didn't see you.

326
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:07,857
You are now 4 and one-half miles
from your destination.

327
00:41:40,737 --> 00:41:43,675
- U-turn, if possible.
- Are you kidding me?

328
00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:48,234
You are now 4.2 miles
from your destination.

329
00:41:49,315 --> 00:41:51,354
Sorry, car.

330
00:41:57,674 --> 00:42:00,153
You are now one mile
from your destination.

331
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:02,953
Yeah, guess who's back, Dom?

332
00:42:05,073 --> 00:42:07,032
Let's go!

333
00:42:11,937 --> 00:42:14,175
Nice car, baby!

334
00:42:56,332 --> 00:42:58,170
Bitch!

335
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:04,150
You are now one-quarter mile
from your destination.

336
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,587
Too early, Dom.

337
00:43:41,347 --> 00:43:42,906
No!

338
00:43:42,907 --> 00:43:45,305
Still a buster.

339
00:43:49,934 --> 00:43:53,613
You have reached your destination.
Goodbye.

340
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:07,451
At least we know
you can't beat me straight up.

341
00:44:07,452 --> 00:44:09,251
I didn't know
there were any rules.

342
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:13,664
Now that's what I call
real driving.

343
00:44:13,665 --> 00:44:15,064
No, that's bullshit, man!

344
00:44:15,065 --> 00:44:17,623
Go cry to your mama, eh?

345
00:44:19,264 --> 00:44:21,583
You work for Braga now.

346
00:44:21,584 --> 00:44:24,943
When the GPS calls, you follow.

347
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:30,862
Driver's license.

348
00:44:30,863 --> 00:44:33,863
What driver's license?

349
00:44:33,864 --> 00:44:36,022
Thumb.

350
00:44:39,823 --> 00:44:42,221
Cell phone number.

351
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:49,181
The print is for Campos.

352
00:44:49,182 --> 00:44:51,660
The number is for me.

353
00:44:56,135 --> 00:44:57,533
Yo, nutsack!

354
00:44:57,534 --> 00:45:01,054
Let me tell you something, man,
muscle beats import every time.

355
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:04,412
You know what I'm saying?
Every time!

356
00:45:04,574 --> 00:45:08,172
Ladies, let's get on
back to Papa Dwight's.

357
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:17,411
Papa Dwight wants you
to take off your shoes.

358
00:45:17,412 --> 00:45:20,931
Dwight likes feet.
Take off your shoes.

359
00:45:21,131 --> 00:45:22,691
So beautiful.

360
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:27,250
Dwight likes this foot a lot.

361
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,570
Yes, baby!

362
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:41,497
- Daddy Dwight loves...
- FBI!

363
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:45,657
- I didn't do nothing, man!
- Dwight didn't do nothing!

364
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:47,496
Hey, no! Stay, stay!
Where you going?

365
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:49,336
- Bye, Dwight!
- No, what did I do?

366
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,496
You're under arrest
for distribution of meth.

367
00:45:52,497 --> 00:45:55,775
Meth? Dwight's never
touched that shit, bro!

368
00:45:55,776 --> 00:45:56,855
Dwight has now.

369
00:45:56,856 --> 00:45:59,215
Yo, that ain't mine!
No!

370
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:01,334
You know that's never
gonna stick, right?

371
00:46:01,335 --> 00:46:04,174
Yeah, it's not supposed to.

372
00:46:06,135 --> 00:46:08,053
Live it up! Live it up!

373
00:47:04,881 --> 00:47:06,999
Yeah, Corona.

374
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,599
That's too bad
about Dwight.

375
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,999
Having the Feds raid your house
the same night you make the team.

376
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,998
So unfortunate.

377
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:19,957
I wish I could say
I was surprised to see you here.

378
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,997
What's to stop someone
from telling them you're a cop?

379
00:47:23,998 --> 00:47:27,677
Probably the same thing that's keeping me
from telling them why you're really here.

380
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,878
- What up, fellows?
- Hey, how you doing?

381
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:33,623
- Great. You having a good time?
- Yeah, a great time.

382
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:36,548
Come on,
let's have a better time.

383
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:40,028
How's your car?
It took a nasty bump.

384
00:47:40,029 --> 00:47:41,587
It'll be ready.

385
00:47:41,588 --> 00:47:44,866
I also heard you just
got out of County.

386
00:47:44,867 --> 00:47:46,706
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

387
00:47:46,707 --> 00:47:48,466
You know a guy
named Jim Garcia?

388
00:47:48,467 --> 00:47:53,025
Nah. Big place.
Lotsa names, lotsa faces.

389
00:47:53,786 --> 00:47:56,785
And you, you're wanted by
a lotta people, homes.

390
00:47:56,786 --> 00:47:59,345
Yeah, that kinda heat
can't be good for business.

391
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:02,225
Yeah, well, that depends
on how you look at things.

392
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:06,038
I go down, I do time.

393
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,638
I do real time.

394
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,432
I don't know about your other drivers,
but when I see flashing lights in my mirror,

395
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:15,517
I don't stop.

396
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,033
Do you know each other?

397
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,825
He used to date
my sister.

398
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:31,797
I see.

399
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:36,562
- You're a lucky man.
- How's that?

400
00:48:37,697 --> 00:48:40,129
You're still breathing.

401
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:49,694
To the ladies we've loved
and the ladies we've lost.

402
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:51,687
- Salute.
- Salute.

403
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:00,597
So, what's Braga about?

404
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:04,083
You know, he's just one of us.

405
00:49:04,814 --> 00:49:07,153
Came up from the streets.
Down for el barrio.

406
00:49:08,256 --> 00:49:10,420
Now he's a shot caller.

407
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,696
The boss of bosses.

408
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,812
See all these cats in here?

409
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:19,053
Any one of them
would die for Braga.

410
00:49:19,054 --> 00:49:21,292
Including you?

411
00:49:22,654 --> 00:49:24,891
Especially me.

412
00:49:33,613 --> 00:49:35,372
Enjoy the party, fellows.
Club's yours.

413
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:39,171
Whatever you want, booze,
broads, it's all good.

414
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:43,930
Braga's mine.

415
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:49,650
I'm taking the whole house down.

416
00:49:49,731 --> 00:49:51,729
Good luck.

417
00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:03,712
Something interests you
about this car?

418
00:52:03,713 --> 00:52:06,552
Just admiring the body work.

419
00:52:07,393 --> 00:52:11,911
Are you one of those boys
who prefers cars to women?

420
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:19,749
I'm one of those boys that appreciates
a fine body, regardless of the make.

421
00:52:22,591 --> 00:52:24,670
Your car?

422
00:52:27,871 --> 00:52:30,149
It's Fenix's car.

423
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:35,229
You'll meet him at the rendezvous.
He'll be leading you.

424
00:52:37,764 --> 00:52:39,762
So now...

425
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:42,802
that I know your taste in cars,

426
00:52:42,803 --> 00:52:45,922
tell me, what about your women?

427
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:49,920
It all starts with the eyes.

428
00:52:51,642 --> 00:52:56,680
She's got to have those kinda eyes that
can look right through the bullshit...

429
00:52:56,681 --> 00:52:59,399
to the good in someone.

430
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:06,879
20% angel, 80% devil.

431
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,238
Down to earth.

432
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:15,997
Ain't afraid to get a little engine
grease under her fingernails.

433
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:25,197
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

434
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,037
It ain't.

435
00:53:38,759 --> 00:53:39,797
- Hi.
- Hi.

436
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:42,837
- I got a gift for you.
- All right.

437
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:45,356
A dirty shot glass,
just what I always wanted.

438
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:46,956
I got these from the club
last night.

439
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,915
There's two sets of prints here.
Run them both.

440
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:52,355
I know one of these is Campos'.
I think the other might be Braga's.

441
00:53:52,356 --> 00:53:54,875
And you're gonna have
to go beyond Interpol.

442
00:53:54,876 --> 00:53:57,235
So, that means I have to contact
individual agencies,

443
00:53:57,236 --> 00:53:58,684
- and that could take weeks.
- Fine.

444
00:53:58,685 --> 00:53:59,754
Okay.

445
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:16,065
Yeah.

446
00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:19,185
That's your third traffic violation
in less than three blocks.

447
00:54:19,186 --> 00:54:21,745
Slow it down, O'Conner.

448
00:54:21,746 --> 00:54:24,065
Sure thing, Dad.

449
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:54,804
He stopped.

450
00:55:48,658 --> 00:55:50,096
We lost him.

451
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,656
- He killed the tracker.
- We don't know that.

452
00:55:51,657 --> 00:55:53,856
- I'm telling you, he killed the tracker.
- We don't know that yet!

453
00:55:53,857 --> 00:55:56,375
Get the bird overhead.

454
00:55:56,777 --> 00:56:00,374
<i>Right now,
I'm moving north, 33', 56'...</i>

455
00:56:03,535 --> 00:56:05,534
All clear.

456
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,706
<i>Base, flag nine,
I'm at Angels 5.</i>

457
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:34,265
I don't have a tally on the target.
Repeat, I don't have a tally on the target.

458
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,985
They're gone,
there's no one down there.

459
00:56:35,986 --> 00:56:37,944
Damn it!

460
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:49,742
This ain't right, bro.

461
00:56:49,743 --> 00:56:52,542
Nobody said nothing about
being locked in no truck.

462
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:54,902
Tell me about it.

463
00:56:58,238 --> 00:57:00,597
Hey. Hey!

464
00:57:01,558 --> 00:57:04,556
Yo! Where'd you think
they're taking us?

465
00:57:04,557 --> 00:57:06,756
Don't matter.

466
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:12,274
We're all just along
for the ride now.

467
00:57:22,236 --> 00:57:24,834
Welcome to Mexico, boys.

468
00:57:30,836 --> 00:57:33,194
There are helicopters
and surveillance cameras...

469
00:57:33,195 --> 00:57:35,634
that scan for heat
signatures at the border.

470
00:57:35,635 --> 00:57:39,513
But there are blind spots that I can
guide you through via satellite.

471
00:57:39,514 --> 00:57:44,513
There can be no margin of error,
so you must follow my every direction.

472
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:46,512
Any questions?

473
00:57:47,794 --> 00:57:50,912
I thought Fenix
was gonna be here.

474
00:57:53,273 --> 00:57:55,951
He'll meet you out there.

475
00:57:59,952 --> 00:58:02,870
All right, everybody, sync up.

476
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,927
Good luck, gentlemen.

477
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:23,326
<i>Satellite linkup engaged.</i>

478
00:58:23,928 --> 00:58:27,526
Keep proceeding northbound
at current speed.

479
00:58:30,647 --> 00:58:33,126
Stay close to Fenix.

480
00:58:33,567 --> 00:58:35,645
He'll lead you across.

481
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,558
I got a heat signature northbound
along Legardo Ravine.

482
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,713
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico
side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds.

483
00:59:01,714 --> 00:59:03,558
Get the camera on it.

484
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:07,917
Manual override... Rerouting
camera to designated coordinates.

485
00:59:10,278 --> 00:59:13,637
Hurry it up.
You guys have been tagged.

486
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,316
Shit.

487
00:59:24,758 --> 00:59:27,756
Toretto, get back in formation.

488
00:59:30,117 --> 00:59:31,835
Reimaging commencing.

489
00:59:39,595 --> 00:59:41,514
I don't see anything.

490
00:59:41,515 --> 00:59:43,354
They're gone.

491
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:48,406
Get the helicopters to cover it.

492
00:59:51,647 --> 00:59:55,325
<i>Base, we're 40 seconds
out from Legardo Ravine.</i>

493
00:59:55,486 --> 00:59:57,725
They're sending a helicopter.

494
00:59:58,606 --> 01:00:01,084
You have 30 seconds.

495
01:00:08,845 --> 01:00:12,523
<i>North 32' 33', west 116' 49'.</i>

496
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:21,188
The window is closing fast.

497
01:00:21,189 --> 01:00:24,907
You need to get outta there
before they send ground support.

498
01:00:30,188 --> 01:00:32,466
Fifteen seconds.

499
01:00:37,027 --> 01:00:39,946
Base, target is at two miles.

500
01:00:51,905 --> 01:00:54,703
You're running out of time.

501
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:59,623
You need to get out now!

502
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:16,480
<i>Base, we're at north 32' 33',
west 116' 49'.</i>

503
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:20,880
We have no visual contact.
Roll ground units for confirmation.

504
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:42,197
Sloppy!

505
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,356
Very sloppy!

506
01:01:49,077 --> 01:01:51,715
What are you doing, man?

507
01:01:55,154 --> 01:01:56,754
Come on.

508
01:01:59,434 --> 01:02:01,392
Get out.

509
01:02:04,034 --> 01:02:05,312
Come on, man.

510
01:02:05,313 --> 01:02:07,272
Come on, today, man.
Come on, let's go.

511
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:09,151
Hey, don't touch me.
Hey, don't touch me, man!

512
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,001
Hey, I said don't touch me, man!

513
01:02:13,002 --> 01:02:14,560
Hey, look, dawg,
don't put your hands on me.

514
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:16,120
Hey, Malik, chill, bro.

515
01:02:16,121 --> 01:02:17,360
Yo, man, what's up
with your boy?

516
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:19,839
Hey, boss man!

517
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,679
What did you say?

518
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,958
I said only pussies
run nitrometh.

519
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:32,478
You looked under my hood?

520
01:02:38,397 --> 01:02:40,117
I'm talking to you.

521
01:02:40,118 --> 01:02:42,915
Got something on your mind?

522
01:02:43,038 --> 01:02:44,995
'70 Plymouth.

523
01:02:48,668 --> 01:02:50,587
Her name was Letty.

524
01:02:52,908 --> 01:02:54,627
Yo.

525
01:02:55,428 --> 01:02:57,786
Where's my money?

526
01:02:58,748 --> 01:03:01,665
And somebody
wrecked her car.

527
01:03:08,466 --> 01:03:10,039
I wrecked her car.

528
01:03:14,066 --> 01:03:15,745
You remember her face?

529
01:03:20,586 --> 01:03:22,224
Huh?

530
01:03:22,385 --> 01:03:24,624
'Cause I don't.

531
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:29,929
Last time I saw it,
it was burning.

532
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,488
Now what?

533
01:03:45,368 --> 01:03:48,687
I'm gonna enjoy
what happens next.

534
01:04:23,328 --> 01:04:25,446
Dom, get in!

535
01:04:26,007 --> 01:04:28,246
Get in! Come on!

536
01:04:29,527 --> 01:04:33,885
Come on! Get in the fucking car!
Let's go! Hurry up!

537
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:01,532
What have you got, Trinh?

538
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:04,369
We're contacting agencies
in multiple countries.

539
01:05:04,677 --> 01:05:09,034
Unfortunately, most of them have to
manually scan their prints for us to upload.

540
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,234
O'Conner's on line five.

541
01:05:12,739 --> 01:05:14,818
And, sir, you should see this.

542
01:05:14,819 --> 01:05:16,938
Thank you.

543
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:27,737
Talk to me, O'Conner.

544
01:05:27,738 --> 01:05:29,896
- Where the hell have you been?
- I got the shipment.

545
01:05:29,897 --> 01:05:32,856
"I got the shipment,"
or "we got the shipment"?

546
01:05:32,857 --> 01:05:34,896
What're you talking about?

547
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:39,854
Traffic cams in the area picked up
pictures of you and Toretto together.

548
01:05:41,288 --> 01:05:45,997
Listen to me, O'Conner. Bring in
the shipment and bring in Toretto.

549
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:48,936
But I thought the point was to get
Braga, we got an opportunity here.

550
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,013
Brian, the clock stopped ticking.

551
01:05:52,778 --> 01:05:55,122
Bring them in. Are we clear?

552
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:00,975
O'Conner?

553
01:06:10,908 --> 01:06:13,032
So this is what
60 million dollars looks like.

554
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:16,849
Yeah, we gotta get you to a doctor.

555
01:06:18,268 --> 01:06:19,711
We got to find
a place to hide this.

556
01:06:23,152 --> 01:06:24,951
I got a spot.

557
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:37,429
502, wet reckless.
I need a 48-hour hold.

558
01:06:39,554 --> 01:06:41,993
Out back.
Any spot you can find.

559
01:06:46,273 --> 01:06:48,752
You sure about this?

560
01:06:48,994 --> 01:06:55,591
Yeah. The last place they'll check,
their own impound yard. Trust me.

561
01:07:01,152 --> 01:07:03,030
You know, I've been thinking,

562
01:07:03,031 --> 01:07:05,470
when you blew up your car
back there, you blew up mine, too.

563
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:07,950
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

564
01:07:07,951 --> 01:07:11,110
So now you owe me
a 10-second car.

565
01:07:13,026 --> 01:07:15,864
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

566
01:07:25,984 --> 01:07:28,302
Now we're even.

567
01:07:42,663 --> 01:07:45,541
Is this your way of keeping me
away from him?

568
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:49,900
- You're the only one I could call.
- He's my brother, of course.

569
01:07:58,446 --> 01:08:01,124
The bullet's not in there.

570
01:08:07,685 --> 01:08:11,564
I'm gonna clean it and stitch it up.
It's gonna hurt.

571
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:14,563
I bet you're gonna enjoy this.

572
01:08:14,564 --> 01:08:16,523
A little.

573
01:08:18,684 --> 01:08:21,083
- Want some of this?
- Yeah.

574
01:08:21,084 --> 01:08:23,722
It's spicy.

575
01:08:24,723 --> 01:08:26,962
I like it hot.

576
01:08:28,999 --> 01:08:31,198
Dom, what're you doing?

577
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:34,676
You reached first,
you have to say grace.

578
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:48,275
Thank you, Lord,
for blessing this table.

579
01:08:48,996 --> 01:08:54,234
With food, family
and friendship.

580
01:09:27,941 --> 01:09:30,858
You asked me why I let Dom go.

581
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:35,418
I think it's because
at that moment,

582
01:09:36,379 --> 01:09:39,777
I respected him
more than I did myself.

583
01:09:43,299 --> 01:09:45,136
Yeah.

584
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:51,875
One thing I learned from Dom is that nothing
really matters unless you have a code.

585
01:09:53,977 --> 01:09:56,855
And what's your code, Brian?

586
01:09:59,746 --> 01:10:02,145
I'm working on it.

587
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:38,004
Shit. Hey, Dom.

588
01:10:38,005 --> 01:10:40,524
- When were you gonna tell me?
- Dom, what are you doing?

589
01:10:40,525 --> 01:10:42,483
When were you gonna tell me
you were running Letty?

590
01:10:42,484 --> 01:10:45,403
- Let me explain...
- When were you gonna...

591
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,869
Dom, stop!

592
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:54,029
- You don't understand.
- I don't understand?

593
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:55,867
Stop!

594
01:10:59,189 --> 01:11:01,027
She did it for...

595
01:11:03,309 --> 01:11:04,868
Dom, stop!

596
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:07,587
Dom, stop it!
Please stop!

597
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:22,438
She did it for you, Dom!
She did it for you!

598
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:30,917
Letty came to me to clear your name
in exchange for bringing down Braga.

599
01:11:33,157 --> 01:11:36,236
She just wanted you to come home!

600
01:11:52,035 --> 01:11:53,834
I'm sorry, Dom!

601
01:11:53,835 --> 01:11:55,873
I'm sorry!

602
01:12:21,413 --> 01:12:27,690
You better have one hell of an
explanation. You disobeyed a direct order.

603
01:12:27,852 --> 01:12:29,850
- Where's the shipment?
- It's safe.

604
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:31,650
It's safe.

605
01:12:31,651 --> 01:12:34,490
Look, we could use the shipment
to parade in front of the media,

606
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:36,410
get a few hundred pounds
of heroin off the street,

607
01:12:36,411 --> 01:12:40,049
but Braga's just gonna send another
shipment next week and the week after that.

608
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:42,169
Let's use the shipment
to lure Braga out...

609
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:44,209
and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.

610
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:46,568
And how do you
suggest we do that?

611
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:48,528
A hand-to-hand
exchange with Braga.

612
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:49,928
He'll never show.

613
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:52,327
He can't afford not to.

614
01:13:01,369 --> 01:13:03,647
You got a plan?

615
01:13:04,407 --> 01:13:06,686
There's a price.

616
01:13:09,754 --> 01:13:13,111
We bag Braga,
you let Toretto walk.

617
01:13:20,872 --> 01:13:23,670
- Yes?
- It's Dom.

618
01:13:23,992 --> 01:13:26,550
I was just thinking about you.

619
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:30,870
You know, when I gave you my number,
I was hoping you'd call.

620
01:13:30,871 --> 01:13:33,629
But not under
these circumstances.

621
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:37,309
What circumstances?
Me being alive?

622
01:13:37,629 --> 01:13:39,988
Don't take it personally.

623
01:13:41,444 --> 01:13:43,363
It's just business.

624
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:45,562
I got some business of my own.

625
01:13:46,124 --> 01:13:48,202
Get Campos.

626
01:13:49,923 --> 01:13:51,961
It's them.

627
01:13:55,442 --> 01:13:56,641
Uh-huh.

628
01:13:56,642 --> 01:14:00,962
Was that how Braga inspires loyalty?
Killing his drivers?

629
01:14:00,963 --> 01:14:03,442
One can always find more drivers.

630
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:05,601
It's just good business.

631
01:14:05,602 --> 01:14:07,081
I wanna trade.

632
01:14:07,082 --> 01:14:09,120
Braga doesn't negotiate.

633
01:14:09,121 --> 01:14:10,161
Fine.

634
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:16,838
You explain to him how all of a sudden
$60 million worth of product disappears.

635
01:14:16,839 --> 01:14:19,717
I know that can't
be good for business.

636
01:14:20,078 --> 01:14:22,037
What'd you want?

637
01:14:22,038 --> 01:14:26,517
Six million cash,
delivered by Braga himself.

638
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,596
I don't like being shot at.

639
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:33,796
I ain't gonna put my neck out again
unless he's got something to lose, too.

640
01:14:33,797 --> 01:14:35,395
He'll never go for it.

641
01:14:35,396 --> 01:14:39,555
Either I deal with Braga,
or you do.

642
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,958
When and where?

643
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:03,917
Sir, players are onsite.
Holding positions at the perimeter.

644
01:15:03,918 --> 01:15:06,477
All right. Listen up.
Everybody stay frosty.

645
01:15:06,478 --> 01:15:09,116
We don't move a muscle until
O'Conner gives the signaI.

646
01:15:10,234 --> 01:15:13,392
When he gets the money,
you know what to do.

647
01:15:13,393 --> 01:15:15,832
Well, the good news is,
when we get this guy,

648
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:18,512
you walk out of here
a free man.

649
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:19,951
Is that what they told you?

650
01:15:19,952 --> 01:15:21,591
Yeah, that's the deal.

651
01:15:21,592 --> 01:15:25,551
You still put milk
and cookies out for Santa Claus?

652
01:15:26,112 --> 01:15:27,910
Yeah.

653
01:15:31,831 --> 01:15:32,950
Here.

654
01:15:32,951 --> 01:15:35,629
In case things go shitty.

655
01:15:41,063 --> 01:15:43,102
Just like old times?

656
01:15:43,103 --> 01:15:45,021
Yeah.

657
01:15:47,782 --> 01:15:49,101
You dropped something.

658
01:15:49,102 --> 01:15:51,261
- That's what you wanted, right?
- Dom...

659
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:08,860
He's harmless.
Don't worry about him.

660
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:12,939
And he's really sorry about Letty.

661
01:16:15,716 --> 01:16:18,114
Where's our stuff?

662
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:23,913
You mean the stuff
that used to be in here, right?

663
01:16:24,355 --> 01:16:28,672
Well, you'll see it when we see Braga.
That was the deal.

664
01:16:28,914 --> 01:16:30,633
No worries.

665
01:16:30,634 --> 01:16:33,232
Braga keeps his word.

666
01:17:17,141 --> 01:17:19,259
$2 million.

667
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:22,939
You get the rest
when I get my property.

668
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,059
- Stasiak.
- We got a match.

669
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,098
The fingerprint's Braga's 100%.

670
01:17:30,099 --> 01:17:32,538
Just waiting on
faciaI confirmation via fax.

671
01:17:32,539 --> 01:17:34,498
I got a question for you.

672
01:17:34,499 --> 01:17:38,777
You wearing pink when you were
clawing your way out of el barrio?

673
01:17:40,243 --> 01:17:41,722
Order all agents to move in.

674
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,802
We got confirmation.
Primary suspect wearing gray suit.

675
01:17:44,803 --> 01:17:45,841
Let's move.

676
01:17:45,842 --> 01:17:47,761
Sir, O'Conner hasn't
given us the signal yet.

677
01:17:47,762 --> 01:17:51,041
What part of that didn't you understand?
We just got confirmation. Do it!

678
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:54,321
Secure primary suspect
in gray suit. Repeat!

679
01:17:54,322 --> 01:17:57,480
Secure primary suspect
in gray suit.

680
01:18:11,174 --> 01:18:14,453
You're thinking
what I'm thinking, right?

681
01:18:16,453 --> 01:18:18,692
He ain't Braga.

682
01:18:22,413 --> 01:18:23,532
Oh, shit.

683
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:26,091
- Drop your weapons!
- FBI!

684
01:18:26,092 --> 01:18:27,411
Get down!

685
01:18:30,692 --> 01:18:33,010
Get outta here!

686
01:18:36,251 --> 01:18:38,729
Get outta here, Dom!

687
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:45,707
Run him down.

688
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:47,507
Go!

689
01:18:47,508 --> 01:18:49,187
Campos is Braga!

690
01:18:56,267 --> 01:18:57,587
Come on.

691
01:19:04,587 --> 01:19:07,145
Approaching primary target.

692
01:19:07,146 --> 01:19:09,905
Primary suspect is secure.

693
01:19:11,785 --> 01:19:14,024
He was under your nose
the whole time.

694
01:19:14,025 --> 01:19:15,784
Now Braga's escaped.

695
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:18,704
Toretto's heading south, probably
long across the border by now.

696
01:19:18,705 --> 01:19:20,904
Do you have any idea the kinda
trouble you're in, O'Conner?

697
01:19:20,905 --> 01:19:22,863
I was doing my job.

698
01:19:22,864 --> 01:19:25,383
He ain't the first bad guy
you helped escape the law's grasp.

699
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:28,804
As of now,
you're being taken off active duty,

700
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:32,323
until this house can
mount a formal inquiry.

701
01:19:33,724 --> 01:19:36,083
What about Braga?

702
01:19:36,444 --> 01:19:39,362
That's no longer your concern.

703
01:19:49,592 --> 01:19:51,111
We now know
where Braga is, right?

704
01:19:51,112 --> 01:19:54,511
Customs tracked him via satellite
to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

705
01:19:54,512 --> 01:19:57,510
Mexico is out of our jurisdiction.

706
01:19:59,512 --> 01:20:01,110
The fact is...

707
01:20:01,111 --> 01:20:05,110
the brass will be so busy holding
press conferences over the seizure,

708
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:07,590
we'll skate under the radar.

709
01:20:07,591 --> 01:20:11,188
I thought we signed on
to do the right thing.

710
01:20:49,737 --> 01:20:52,137
Everyone's looking for you.

711
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:54,376
I'm right here.

712
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:56,296
It's nice to see you've gone
with the times...

713
01:20:56,297 --> 01:21:00,415
and switched to electronic
fuel injection. Looks good.

714
01:21:00,817 --> 01:21:03,495
Buster became a gearhead.

715
01:21:06,736 --> 01:21:09,135
I'm going with you.

716
01:21:12,215 --> 01:21:15,454
I don't plan on
bringing anyone back.

717
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:19,755
I know.

718
01:21:27,475 --> 01:21:29,754
Hit that throttle.

719
01:21:55,769 --> 01:21:57,527
Hey.

720
01:22:36,924 --> 01:22:40,482
How do you say goodbye
to your only brother?

721
01:22:44,114 --> 01:22:46,153
You don't.

722
01:23:54,431 --> 01:23:56,790
I thought you weren't
gonna show up.

723
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:59,029
You saved my life.

724
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:02,229
I'm willing to return the favor.

725
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:08,348
This will help get you to Braga.

726
01:24:11,709 --> 01:24:13,427
Dom.

727
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:16,907
Going in there is suicide.

728
01:24:25,624 --> 01:24:27,983
I have no choice.

729
01:24:30,744 --> 01:24:33,781
You must have
loved her very much.

730
01:24:50,422 --> 01:24:53,700
So this is where
my jurisdiction ends.

731
01:24:59,891 --> 01:25:02,649
And this is where
mine begins.

732
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:14,770
You ain't forgiven.

733
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:19,569
You boys wanna arrest me?

734
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:25,048
No, we're beyond that.

735
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:28,768
You can't buy
your way outta this one.

736
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:31,687
You and me...

737
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:35,567
You and me,
we're not so different.

738
01:27:37,741 --> 01:27:39,939
You're no hero.

739
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,739
You're right.

740
01:27:54,809 --> 01:27:58,686
And that's why you're going
back across the border.

741
01:28:03,767 --> 01:28:06,085
But Fenix is mine.

742
01:28:06,367 --> 01:28:08,086
You got it.

743
01:28:30,344 --> 01:28:31,503
Shit!

744
01:28:36,263 --> 01:28:40,341
You'll make it a couple of miles out,
if you're lucky.

745
01:29:32,523 --> 01:29:35,361
You know where you're going?

746
01:29:35,682 --> 01:29:38,440
You wanna borrow my GPS?

747
01:29:41,322 --> 01:29:43,041
Where are your boys at?

748
01:29:43,042 --> 01:29:44,601
Are they gonna
show up or what?

749
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:50,480
Careful what you ask for.

750
01:30:06,771 --> 01:30:09,569
Just stop.
Just stop the car.

751
01:30:28,248 --> 01:30:30,566
Right behind you.

752
01:30:45,682 --> 01:30:49,321
Dom, head to the tunnel.
Let's use the tunnel.

753
01:31:14,758 --> 01:31:17,316
Get outta here, Brian.

754
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:29,709
You sure you know where
the tunnels are? You sure?

755
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,068
Yeah. I'd hold on.

756
01:31:34,349 --> 01:31:36,627
This might hurt.

757
01:31:48,788 --> 01:31:51,547
You're in my world now, baby!

758
01:32:20,606 --> 01:32:23,124
That's it, baby!
End of the road.

759
01:32:23,125 --> 01:32:25,203
Now what?

760
01:32:25,284 --> 01:32:26,403
Game over.

761
01:32:26,404 --> 01:32:28,562
No, no, no.

762
01:32:57,761 --> 01:32:59,799
Come on!

763
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:20,270
Hey!

764
01:34:20,671 --> 01:34:23,109
Get me outta here!

765
01:35:52,652 --> 01:35:54,691
Pussy.

766
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:12,928
Let me see that.

767
01:36:14,689 --> 01:36:17,608
Yeah.
Just keep pressure there.

768
01:36:17,609 --> 01:36:19,642
You'll be all right.

769
01:36:26,474 --> 01:36:29,152
You gotta get outta here.

770
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:33,593
I ain't running anymore.

771
01:36:38,314 --> 01:36:40,952
I gotta ask you something.

772
01:36:40,953 --> 01:36:42,711
Yeah?

773
01:36:43,201 --> 01:36:47,759
You know I would have won that race
if you didn't cheat, right?

774
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,959
You hit your head hard.

775
01:36:56,559 --> 01:36:59,038
Don't make me laugh.

776
01:37:10,186 --> 01:37:12,184
All rise.

777
01:37:16,585 --> 01:37:18,903
Please be seated.

778
01:37:22,304 --> 01:37:24,942
Please rise, Mr. Toretto.

779
01:37:26,544 --> 01:37:29,222
I've listened to the testimony...

780
01:37:29,223 --> 01:37:31,343
and taken into
special consideration

781
01:37:31,344 --> 01:37:35,862
Agent O'Conner's appeal of clemency
on behalf of Mr. Toretto.

782
01:37:36,103 --> 01:37:38,742
That his actions directly
resulted in the apprehension...

783
01:37:38,743 --> 01:37:42,141
of known drug
trafficker Arturo Braga.

784
01:37:45,014 --> 01:37:47,012
However,

785
01:37:47,574 --> 01:37:49,533
this judiciary finds that...

786
01:37:49,534 --> 01:37:54,812
one right does not make up
for a lifetime worth of wrongs.

787
01:37:54,813 --> 01:37:56,572
And as such,

788
01:37:56,573 --> 01:38:02,051
I find that I am forced to level the
maximum sentence under California law.

789
01:38:03,692 --> 01:38:05,970
Dominic Toretto,

790
01:38:06,091 --> 01:38:10,010
you are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life...

791
01:38:10,011 --> 01:38:13,649
at the Lompoc maximum security
prison system...

792
01:38:13,691 --> 01:38:16,929
without the possibility
of early parole.

793
01:38:16,930 --> 01:38:19,877
This court is adjourned.

794
01:38:27,698 --> 01:38:34,234
