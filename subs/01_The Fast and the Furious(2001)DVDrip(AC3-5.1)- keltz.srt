1
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,920
Just packed up a real money load,
and it's coming your way.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Look for "Rodgers" on the truck's side.
Don't forget my share of the deal.

3
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,600
Shit!

4
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,520
-Tuna on white, no crust, right?
-I don't know. How is it?

5
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,320
Every day, for the last three weeks,
you've come here, asking how the tuna is.

6
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,000
Now, it was crappy yesterday.
It was crappy the day before.

7
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,760
And guess what? It hasn't changed.

8
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,160
-I'll have the tuna.
-No crust?

9
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,320
No crust.

10
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
Thank you.

11
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,040
Talk to me, Jesse.
This ain't working, brother.

12
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,640
It's your fuel map. It's got a nasty hole.

13
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,680
-That's why you're unloading in third.
-Told you.

14
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:07,680
I lengthen the injector pulse a millisecond.
Just tune the NOS timer, you'll run nines.

15
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,720
What's up with this fool?
Is he sandwich-crazy?

16
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,240
-No. He ain't here for the food, dog.
-Chill out. He's slinging parts for Harry.

17
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,680
-I know what he's slinging.
-He's trying to get in Mia's pants, dog.

18
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,880
-What's up, guys?
-How you doing, Mia?

19
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,040
-How you living, girl?
-Hey!

20
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,920
Hey, Dom. You want something to drink?

21
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,480
-He's beautiful.
-I like his haircut.

22
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,080
Vince!

23
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,200
-What?
-Can I get you anything?

24
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,120
You look good.

25
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,720
-Thanks a lot, Mia. See you tomorrow.
-Sure.

26
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,400
-Tomorrow?
-I love this part.

27
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,400
Try Fatburger from now on. Get yourself a
Double Cheese with fries for $2.95, faggot.

28
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,840
-I like the tuna here.
-Bullshit. No one likes the tuna here.

29
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,280
Yeah, well, I do.

30
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,640
Jesus Christ, Dom! Would you get out
there? I'm sick of this shit.

31
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,960
I'm not kidding, Dom. Get out there!

32
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,560
-What did you put in that sandwich?
-That's funny.

33
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,800
-Dom!
-All right.

34
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,320
-Hey, man. He was in my face.
-I'm in your face.

35
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,680
Relax! Don't push it! You embarrass me!

36
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,440
Get over there!

37
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,640
Jesse, give me the wallet.

38
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,600
"Brian Earl Spilner."
Sounds like a serial killer name.

39
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,480
-Is that what you are?
-No, man.

40
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,440
Don't come around here again.

41
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,560
Hey, man. This is bullshit.

42
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,480
-You work for Harry, right?
-Yeah. I just started.

43
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,160
You were just fired.

44
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,520
Hey, Dominic.
I appreciate what you did, in a big way.

45
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,480
Dominic, I owe you.

46
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,680
Brian, you're messing with my business.
When Dominic drives, he's golden.

47
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,240
Kids pour in. They want everything he has.
Every performance part. They pay cash!

48
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,400
-What did Dominic say?
-You don't want to know.

49
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,480
-What did Dominic say?
-He wants you out of here.

50
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,920
-He wants me out of here?
-Yes.

51
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,120
-And what did you say to Dom?
-What do you think I said?

52
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,800
I told him, "Good help is hard to find."

53
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,840
Relax.

54
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
I need NOS.

55
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,240
-I need NOS.
-No.

56
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,080
My car topped out at 140 miles per hour,
this morning.

57
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,360
Amateurs don't use nitrous oxide. I've
seen how you drive. You've a heavy foot.

58
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,120
-You'll blow yourself to pieces.
-I need one of these.

59
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,600
One of the big ones.
Actually, let's make it two.

60
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,160
And, Harry, I need it by tonight.

61
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,160
Hold up, hold up.
Look at this snowman right here, man.

62
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,080
Sweet ride.
What you running under there, man?

63
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,480
-Going to make me find out the hard way?
-Hell, yeah.

64
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,320
You brave. You brave.
They call me Hector.

65
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,600
I got a last name, too,
but I can't pronounce it.

66
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,040
-Brian Spilner.
-Typical white-boy name.

67
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,160
Know what I'm saying?

68
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,040
See that over there? That's mine.
My baby. I ain't cutting her loose tonight.

69
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,040
-Why not?
-I'm going legit, homey.

70
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,720
Trying to get on the NIRA circuit.
Heard about that?

71
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,680
-Hell, yeah.
-So, what's up with you, man?

72
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,880
-I'm just waiting for Toretto.
-Shit. Better get in line. This yours?

73
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,360
-I'm standing next to it.
-That's funny.

74
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,080
You know,
Edwin happens to know a few things.

75
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,280
And one of the things Edwin knows is:
It's not how you stand by your car...

76
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,480
...it's how you race your car.
You better learn that.

77
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, shit. Here they come. It's on.

78
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,480
-Dom.
-Marvin.

79
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,560
-Hey, Dom. How you doing?
-Hey, Camille. You been doing yoga?

80
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
You did? Of course you did. Monica.

81
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,200
I smell skanks.

82
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,600
Why don't you girls pack it up,
before I leave tread marks on your face?

83
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,600
Okay.

84
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,400
-Letty, I was just talking.
-Yeah. Whatever.

85
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,680
-Okay, Hector.
-Yeah? What's up, man?

86
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,800
-Yo. What's up?
-Edwin.

87
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,160
-How we doing this tonight?
-One race.

88
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,600
$2,000 buy-in. Winner takes all.
Hector, you're going to hold the cash.

89
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,960
-Why Hector?
-Too slow to make away with the money.

90
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,880
-Okay. Good luck, guys.
-Hey, wait. Hold up.

91
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
I don't have any cash.
But I do have the pink slip to my car.

92
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,200
You just can't climb in the ring with Ali,
'cause you think you box.

93
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,520
He knows I can box. Check it out.
It's like this.

94
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,440
I lose, the winner takes my car.
Clean and clear.

95
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,080
But if I win, I take the cash,
and I take the respect.

96
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,680
Respect.

97
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,240
To some people, that's more important.

98
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,560
That your car?

99
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,800
I see a cool air intake. It's got a NOS
fogger system and a T4 turbo, Dominic.

100
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,760
I see an AIC controller.
It has direct port nitrous injection.

101
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,680
Yeah. And a stand-alone
fuel management system.

102
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,600
Not a bad way to spend $10,000.

103
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,920
You see that shit?

104
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,880
He's got enough NOS in there
to blow himself up. Period.

105
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,840
-So, what do you say? Am I worthy?
-We don't know yet.

106
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,240
But you're in. Let's go.

107
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,560
-All right.
-Let's go!

108
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,040
-What the hell is going on around here?
-Street's closed, pizza boy.

109
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,320
-Find another way home.
-Goddamn street racers.

110
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,160
Log on, 22. Code 3. Tension is high.
They've blocked the street.

111
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,760
Edwin.

112
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,080
This is yours, whether you win or lose.

113
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,440
But if you win, you get her, too.

114
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,040
You're going to win.

115
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,880
I'm going to win.

116
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,200
We had a reported homicide.
187, at Barabian Liquors.

117
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,480
I've got a 187 in Glendale.
Cops are all over it. We're good to roll.

118
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,520
-All right.
-Let's race!

119
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,560
Right.

120
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,680
Go!

121
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,320
Hell, yeah!

122
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,320
Damn, that guy's fast.

123
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,200
Let's go! Ménage!

124
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,840
No! Monica!

125
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,360
Shut up!

126
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,280
Well done, baby!

127
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,080
Come on. Come on. Back up.

128
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,080
Here's what you won, right here.
There you go.

129
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,920
You were racing a bunch of skateboards.
Know what I mean?

130
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,840
My sister holds the money. Count it.

131
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,280
And you're my trophy.

132
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,160
-Hey, Monica. What's up, baby?
-What's your problem? You didn't win.

133
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,240
Fuck you then!

134
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,240
Was that fun?

135
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,280
Got a problem there, buddy?

136
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,880
-What are you smiling about?
-Dude. I almost had you.

137
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,320
You almost had me?

138
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,320
You never had me.
You never had your car.

139
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,520
Granny-shifting.
Not double-clutching, like you should.

140
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,400
You're lucky that 100-shot of NOS
didn't blow the welds on the intake.

141
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,800
-Almost had me?
-You tell him, Dominic. Get out of here.

142
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,080
Now, me and the mad scientist
got to rip apart the block...

143
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,600
...and replace the piston rings you fried.

144
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,040
Ask any racer. Any real racer.

145
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,040
It don't matter if you win by an inch
or a mile. Winning's winning.

146
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,600
Yeah!

147
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,920
All available units,
we have street-racing along Hawthorne....

148
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,800
Oh, shit! We got cops. Cops!

149
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,320
Go!

150
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,280
Cops! Get in the car! Go!

151
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,200
Toretto, stop right there!

152
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,880
Toretto!

153
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,440
Get in!

154
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,280
You're the last person in the world
I expected to show up.

155
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,160
I thought if I got in your good graces,
you might let me keep my car.

156
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,600
You are in my good graces,
but you ain't keeping your car.

157
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,320
You drive like you've done this before.
Are you a wheelman?

158
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,680
-No.
-You boost cars?

159
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,040
-No. Never.
-Ever done time?

160
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,640
Couple of overnighters. No big deal.

161
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,280
What about the two years
in juvie for boosting cars?

162
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,600
Tucson, right?

163
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,240
I had Jesse run a profile on you,
Brian Earl Spilner.

164
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,760
He'll find anything on the Web.
Anything about anybody.

165
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,800
So, why bullshit?

166
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,880
So, what about you?

167
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,680
Two years in Lompoc.

168
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,320
I'll die before I go back.

169
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,080
-Oh, great.
-What?

170
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,200
It's going to be a long-ass night.
That's what.

171
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,640
Follow us.

172
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:42,320
I thought we had an agreement.
You stay away. I stay away.

173
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,240
Everybody stays happy.

174
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,560
We got lost.
What do you want me to tell you?

175
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,480
-Who's "we"?
-My new mechanic.

176
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,560
Brian, meet Johnny Tran.

177
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,600
The guy in the snakeskin pants.
That's his cousin. Lance.

178
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,200
So, when are you going to give me a shot
at that Honda 2000 of yours?

179
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,600
-This your ride?
-It was. It's his now.

180
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,400
No, it's not. I haven't taken delivery.

181
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,040
Then, it's nobody's car.
But somebody put in the wrench time.

182
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,440
-What do you think, Lance?
-It's an amazing machine.

183
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,520
Yes, indeed.

184
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,000
Let's go.

185
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,280
I'll see you in the desert next month.
Be ready to have your ass handed to you.

186
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,240
-You'll need more than that crotch rocket.
-I got something for you.

187
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,960
-What the hell was that all about?
-Long story. I'll tell you later.

188
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,640
Let's get out of here.

189
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,960
NOS!

190
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,960
-So, what the hell was that all about?
-It's a long story.

191
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
Well, we got a 20-mile hike. Humor me.

192
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,640
A business deal that went sour.

193
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,520
Plus, I made the mistake
of sleeping with his sister.

194
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,840
Take care.

195
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,200
Yo, Spilner.

196
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,680
-You want a beer?
-Yeah, sure.

197
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,840
Oh, shit.

198
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,760
We were all there, right? Falling behind.

199
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,200
-With all that nitrous.
-Yeah.

200
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,080
Yo, Dom. We were just about to go
looking for you, brother.

201
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,000
Where were you?

202
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,200
There were mass cops there. They came in
from every direction. It was orchestrated.

203
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,560
-This your beer?
-Yeah, that's my beer.

204
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,880
Yo, Einstein. Take it upstairs.

205
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,000
You can't detail a car with the cover on.

206
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,560
-Can't even get that right.
-You all right?

207
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,400
-Am I all right?
-It was just a question.

208
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,200
Yo, Dom.

209
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,400
-Why did you bring the buster here?
-'Cause he kept me out of handcuffs!

210
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,320
He didn't just run back to the fort!
The buster brought me back.

211
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,560
You can have any brew you want,
as long as it's a Corona.

212
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,720
-Thanks, man.
-That's Vince's. So, enjoy it.

213
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,840
You.

214
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,600
-Hey, bro. You got a bathroom?
-Upstairs. First door on the right.

215
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,440
He's got no call being up in here.
You don't know that fool for shit.

216
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,880
-He's right, Dom.
-There was a time when I didn't know you.

217
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,840
That was in the third grade!

218
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,320
-Yeah. So, what girls are here?
-You name it. You want mine?

219
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,680
-You need to shut the....
-You want two?

220
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,480
-You don't have anything?
-You look a bit tired.

221
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,240
I think you should go upstairs
and give me a massage.

222
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,520
-Look at all our guests.
-How about you give me a massage?

223
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,160
Crazy lady.

224
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,080
You know you owe me
a 10-second car, right?

225
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,720
Oh, shit.

226
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,840
Did you wipe the seat?

227
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,160
Jesus Christ! Would you cut this shit?
Come on!

228
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,880
-Come on. Let's go get me a drink.
-We were just about to get along.

229
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,840
-So, what do you want?
-Anything, as long as it's cold.

230
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,840
You know, my brother likes you.
He usually doesn't like anybody.

231
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,040
-He's a complicated guy.
-Yeah? What about you?

232
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,320
-I'm simpler.
-You're a shitty liar.

233
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,200
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

234
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,400
-But there's a problem.
-What's that?

235
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,600
You need to get some sleep.

236
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,920
And you definitely,
definitely need a shower.

237
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,080
Come on. I'll take you home.

238
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,800
Show me your hands.
Very good. Now open the door.

239
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,240
Put your hands on your head.
Behind your head.

240
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,240
Face the front of the vehicle,
walk backwards towards the rear.

241
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,640
Take two steps to your right.
Stop right there.

242
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,360
-What did I do?
-Shut up. He's clean, Sarge.

243
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,920
Damn!
Muse, will you take these things off?

244
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,840
-Shit. You put them on so tight.
-I like realism.

245
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,640
You never know who's watching, Brian.

246
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,400
Nice crib, Sergeant. It's a lot nicer
than the last place you confiscated.

247
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,560
Ain't it? Eddie Fisher built this house
for Elizabeth Taylor in the '50s.

248
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,520
You see, even the cops
are Hollywood in Hollywood.

249
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,320
Okay, here he is,
fresh from Toretto's hot rod heaven.

250
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,600
That was an $80,000 vehicle, Officer.

251
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,840
-You told him what happened?
-He knows.

252
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,680
-Send the bill to Johnny Tran.
-The kid's giving me attitude?

253
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,400
It doesn't speak well
for police FBI relations, Tanner.

254
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,920
-I walk in the door and the guy's already--
-All right, all right.

255
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,160
We'll talk, okay? Let's talk about it.

256
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,360
Muse, why don't you make us
four iced cappuccinos, please?

257
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,680
-Come on.
-Regular or decaf, Sarge?

258
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,600
Decaf, I think.

259
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,520
Four hijackings in two months,
and we have nothing.

260
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,560
The DVD players and digital cameras
are worth $1.2 million...

261
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,320
...which brings the grand total
to $6 million plus.

262
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,120
We're in the political crosshairs now, Brian.

263
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,560
That's why you're undercover.

264
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,440
You want that detective badge fast, kid.
And you want to know something?

265
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,520
The FBI can help,
if you come through for us.

266
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,400
What does the truckdriver say?

267
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,840
He gave us the same M.O.:
Three Honda Civics, precision driving...

268
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,800
...the same green neon glow
from under the chassis.

269
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,160
Lab says the skidmarks came back
the same: Mashamoto ZX tires.

270
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,840
So, we know it's somebody
in the street-racing world.

271
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,200
If we don't make this case, the truckers
will take matters into their own hands.

272
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,920
I tell them we're close.

273
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,880
Are you going to make me a liar?

274
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,480
Look, what do we know?

275
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,920
We know this world
revolves around Toretto, right?

276
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm not saying that he's the one
that's popping these trucks...

277
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,200
...but I can guarantee he knows who is.
It's just a matter of time until I win--

278
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,080
You want time, buy the magazine.
We don't have time.

279
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,800
Just get me something I can use.

280
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,160
Is Harry cooperating?

281
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,720
Like a guy that'll do time
for receiving stolen property if he doesn't.

282
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,840
What kind of vibe
is he getting from Toretto?

283
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,880
He's scared of him,
but he doesn't think he's jacking trucks.

284
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,280
-He's too controlled for that.
-Wait.

285
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,320
Not that I want to contradict
Harry's fine judge of character...

286
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,800
...but Toretto did hard time
for nearly beating a guy to death.

287
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,880
He's got nitrous oxide in his blood
and a gas tank for a brain.

288
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,800
Do not turn your back on him.

289
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,720
Tanner, I'm gonna need another car.

290
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,320
-What about parts and service?
-Hold off on it.

291
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,640
Dom, I don't know what to do with it.

292
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,320
All right, what the hell is this?
What do you got there?

293
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,280
-This is your car.
-My car?

294
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,760
I said a 10-second car, not a 10-minute car.

295
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,520
You could push this across the finish line,
or tow it.

296
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,560
You couldn't even tow that
across the finish line.

297
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,400
No faith.

298
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,800
I have faith in you,
but this isn't a junkyard.

299
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,040
-This is a garage.
-Pop the hood.

300
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,560
-Pop the hood?
-Pop the hood.

301
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,080
-2JZ engine. No shit.
-And what did I tell you?

302
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,800
-I retract my previous statement.
-You know what?

303
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,240
This will decimate all
after you put about $15,000 in it.

304
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,960
Or more,
if we have to overnight parts from Japan.

305
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,000
-We'll put it on my tab at Harry's.
-Yes!

306
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,000
I gotta get you racing again
so I can make some money off your ass.

307
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,160
There's a show down in the desert
called Race Wars.

308
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,440
That's where you'll do it.

309
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,000
When you're not working at Harry's,
you're working here.

310
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,840
If you can't find the right tool
in this garage, Mr. Arizona...

311
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,320
...you don't belong near a car.

312
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,080
He owns you now.

313
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,000
Tell me what you think about this.
Koni adjustables.

314
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,920
Gonna save us about 2 pounds.

315
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,320
And they're gonna give us
better traction for the hole shot.

316
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,600
All right?

317
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,360
This is your basic layout of the car.

318
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,160
And that's pretty much
what it could look like when it's finished.

319
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,200
Red, green.

320
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,160
-You should be going to MIT or something.
-Yeah, right.

321
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,560
No, I got that.... What's it called?

322
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,640
That attention disorder--

323
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,280
-ADD?
-Yes, that shit. Yeah.

324
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,160
You know, I was good in algebra
and like math and shit.

325
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,560
Everything else I failed.
Dropped out of school.

326
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,360
I don't know.
It's just something about engines...

327
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,440
...that calms me down, you know.

328
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,840
-I'm outta here.
-Come on, dog.

329
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,000
-Yo, Dom.
-Vince, get over here and give us a hand.

330
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,880
Looks like you got
all the help you need, brother.

331
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,960
-Mia! The chicken's dry.
-All right. I'm coming out already.

332
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,560
Here you go.

333
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,760
Hey, hold up.

334
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:10,240
Because you were the first to reach in
to get the chicken, you say grace.

335
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,640
-Dear heavenly....
-Spirit.

336
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,800
Spirit. Thank you.

337
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Thank you for providing us
with a direct port nitrous injection...

338
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,960
...four core intercoolers
and ball-bearing turbos...

339
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,480
...and titanium valve springs.

340
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,800
-Thank you.
-Amen.

341
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,760
-Not bad.
-Amen.

342
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,960
He was praying to the car gods, man.

343
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,760
He's not the best.

344
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,880
-What do you want?
-Practice.

345
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,280
Thank you, girl.

346
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,800
Look who it is. "Old Coyotes 'R' Us."

347
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,520
I thought you weren't hungry, pumpkin.

348
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,520
-You know, I gotta eat.
-He's always hungry.

349
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,560
All right, sit down.

350
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,440
How you doing, Mia?

351
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,080
Here you go.

352
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,920
-Jesse, hand me that chicken.
-Let's eat some grub, man.

353
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,960
-Want some of that chicken?
-What, you rent a movie or something?

354
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,600
Need a hand with anything else?

355
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,000
No, I'm good. You can go join the boys
and watch the movie.

356
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,040
-The cook doesn't clean where I come from.
-I'd like to go there.

357
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,040
-I think we should go out sometime.
-No, I don't date my brother's friends.

358
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,160
That sucks.

359
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,440
-I'll have to kick his ass then.
-I'd love to see that one.

360
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,640
I would pay to see that one, actually.

361
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,680
Wash my car when you get done.

362
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,280
-What was that?
-No, Mia. I'm talking to the punk.

363
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,440
Wear your favorite dress,
'cause when you're done...

364
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,640
...I'm putting you on the street
where you belong, cutie.

365
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,360
Is this thing broken?
What's wrong with this thing?

366
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,440
What was that Cuban restaurant
you wanted to take me to?

367
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,480
The one with the picadillo and--

368
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,200
-With red candles, wooden tables--
-The plantain, food all over the place.

369
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,120
-What it's called?
-Cha Cha Cha.

370
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,080
-Yeah, that's it.
-Yeah.

371
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,080
Well, you can take me there.

372
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,760
Friday night at 10:00. Is that good for you?

373
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,320
-Yeah, it's perfect.
-Good.

374
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,240
-There's no popcorn.
-Make your own goddamn popcorn!

375
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,120
All right. Now that's valet parking.

376
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,120
-Harry. What's up, dog?
-Nice to see you.

377
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,920
Excellent. Come on in, man.

378
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,000
-Check it. It's yours.
-Damn. What do we got here?

379
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,480
-Hired some new help?
-Don't even think about it.

380
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,960
-What's up?
-What's up, Brian? How you feeling?

381
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,840
-Pretty good. What do you need?
-What's up, man?

382
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,280
I need you to hook me up.
Three of everything. I made a list.

383
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,760
Why don't you look that over?

384
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,080
-When do you need this stuff by?
-Tomorrow, today, now.

385
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,600
-Right.
-White boys work fast, don't they?

386
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,040
That's right.

387
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,160
-You said you need three of each?
-Yeah, three of everything.

388
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,480
What do you think about that?
Check this out.

389
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,840
He moans like a cop.

390
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,760
Brian, this is one of those times
you need to be clear about what you say.

391
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,360
Nod if you understand me.

392
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,680
Nod!

393
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,840
Sit up.

394
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,400
Tell me what the hell you're doing
down here.

395
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,040
Shit. What I'm doing?

396
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,840
Dom.

397
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,600
I owe you a 10-second car.

398
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,960
And what this is about,
this is about Race Wars.

399
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,720
I just went in there,
and Hector is gonna be running...

400
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,640
...three Honda Civics with Spoon engines.

401
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,480
And on top of that,
he just came into Harry's...

402
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,640
...and he ordered three T66 turbos,
with NOS...

403
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,160
...and a MoTeC system exhaust.

404
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,200
So, what are you saying?

405
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,720
You're gonna check everybody's shit out,
one garage after another?

406
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,880
Yeah.

407
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,360
Because, Dom, you know I can't lose again.

408
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,600
He's a cop.

409
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,880
He's a cop!

410
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,360
You a cop?

411
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,320
Let's go for a little ride.

412
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,560
Walk!

413
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,800
Okay. You stand watch.

414
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,840
Yo, Dominic.

415
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,120
There's no engines.

416
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,880
What are they planning on racing with,
hopes and dreams?

417
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,240
I don't know, but they're sneaky as shit...

418
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,080
...and they've got enough money
to buy anything.

419
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:07,920
What?

420
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,000
We got a wolf pack.

421
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,000
It's Johnny Tran,
and he's coming your way really fast.

422
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,960
All right, we got company. Spilner.

423
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,080
Come on. Move!

424
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,280
Let me ask you a question, Ted.

425
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,760
-Do you see anything wrong here?
-No.

426
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,800
-We got no engines, do we?
-No.

427
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,120
-Do we?
-No.

428
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,560
A couple of Nissan SR20 motors
will pull a premium...

429
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,560
-...one week before Race Wars, huh?
-Yeah, probably.

430
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,840
You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

431
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,080
What are you feeling, Lance?

432
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,040
40-weight?

433
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,240
50-weight?

434
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,520
A 40-weight sounds nice.

435
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,960
Where are they, Ted?

436
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,840
-Where are they?
-Enough!

437
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,400
-Where are they?
-They're in a warehouse.

438
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,760
They're in a warehouse, man!

439
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,600
Ted.

440
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,280
Kiss my shoes?

441
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,880
Let's go get our engines.

442
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,400
My superiors are flying in from D.C.,
in two days.

443
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,040
I want something to show.

444
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,480
We've got a fence
with a lube hose in his mouth...

445
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,040
...automatic weapons,
priors on every one of these Asian punks...

446
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,360
...a garage full of DVD players
and generally psychotic behavior.

447
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,640
Tell me why we shouldn't move
on Tran now and figure it out later?

448
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,400
Because all we have is behavior.

449
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,480
Let me get hard evidence,
because what we have now is just--

450
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,440
What we have is probable cause.

451
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,240
And truckers arming themselves for some
good old-fashioned vigilante mayhem.

452
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,280
-Tell us about Hector, Brian.
-Latinos with spear guns. Give me a break.

453
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,960
Hector's still working on the engines,
but the tires don't match.

454
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,760
Will somebody give me a cigarette?

455
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,880
-Get him a cigarette.
-Don't give him one.

456
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,480
-I thought you quit.
-I did. Just give me one.

457
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,200
-Get him a cigarette.
-No!

458
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,000
Tell me about Toretto.

459
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,920
I told you,
I think he's too controlled for this.

460
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,440
Going suicidal on semi-trucks? No way.
Maybe Vince. But he's too dumb to do it.

461
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,320
-I think the kid sister's blurring your vision.
-What did you say?

462
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,840
I don't blame you.
I'd get off on her surveillance photos, too.

463
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,720
Knock it off!

464
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,280
What? Are you going native on me, Brian?

465
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,880
Have you read Toretto's file lately?

466
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,360
-Yeah. I memorized that file.
-Read it again.

467
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,760
No, better still, take a look at these.

468
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,720
Remember I told you about the guy
he nearly beat to death?

469
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,280
Toretto did this
with a three-quarter-inch torque wrench.

470
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,680
He's a model of self-control.

471
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,120
I need a few more days.

472
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,880
I need a few more days.

473
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,240
Got a TR7 here,
with a ball-bearing upgrade.

474
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,240
What it's going to do is,
it's going to spool up really quick.

475
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,800
-I got this set up for 24 psi.
-Got it.

476
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,920
You got big plans tonight?

477
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah. We're going out to dinner.

478
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,000
You break her heart, I'll break your neck.

479
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,080
That's not gonna happen.

480
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,760
I want to show you something.

481
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,120
Me and my dad built her.

482
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,240
Nine hundred horses of Detroit muscle.

483
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,680
It's a beast.

484
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,000
-You know what she ran in Palmdale?
-No. What?

485
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,560
Nine seconds flat.

486
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,040
-God.
-My dad was driving.

487
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,600
So much torque,
the chassis twisted coming off the line.

488
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,520
Barely kept her on the track.

489
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,040
-So, what's your best time?
-I've never driven her.

490
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,160
Why not?

491
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,680
It scares the shit out of me.

492
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,200
That's my dad.

493
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,240
He was coming up
in the pro stock-car circuit.

494
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,280
Last race of the season.

495
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,400
A guy named Kenny Linder
came up from inside, in the final turn.

496
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,560
He clipped his bumper
and put him into the wall at 120.

497
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,880
I watched my dad burn to death.

498
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,280
I remembered hearing him scream.

499
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,720
But the people that were there
said he had died before the tanks blew.

500
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,120
They said it was me who was screaming.

501
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,800
I saw Linder about a week later.

502
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,440
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

503
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,280
And I didn't intend to keep hitting him,
but when I finished, I couldn't lift my arm.

504
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,640
He's a janitor at a high school.

505
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,160
He has to take the bus to work every day.

506
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,920
And they banned me
from the tracks for life.

507
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,680
I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.

508
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,160
Nothing else matters.
Not the mortgage, not the store...

509
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,600
...not my team and all their bullshit.

510
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,560
For those 10 seconds or less...

511
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,560
...I'm free.

512
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,360
So, how is it, anyways,
that the gang came to be?

513
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,640
-What?
-The gang.

514
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,040
The gang?
No, they don't call themselves a gang.

515
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,360
-What do they call themselves?
-They're a team.

516
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,320
-They call themselves a team.
-All right. How did the team come to be?

517
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,960
Well, that's a whole lot of history.

518
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,840
-I've got time.
-Okay. Vince grew up with my brother.

519
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,760
Actually, he didn't ever actually grow up,
as you can tell.

520
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,760
But they were friends as kids.

521
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,440
And Letty, she just lived down the street.

522
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,760
Always into cars, though.
Ever since she was, like, 10 years old.

523
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,280
So, naturally, you know,
my brother always had her attention.

524
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,440
-And then she turned 16--
-And then she had Dom's attention.

525
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,520
Yeah. It's funny how that works, isn't it?

526
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,440
Yeah.

527
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,960
How does Jesse fit into the whole thing?

528
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,880
Jesse. Well, Jesse and Leon just sort of
showed up one night and never, ever left.

529
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,800
It's just the way my brother is, you know.
Dom's like....

530
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,200
He's like gravity.

531
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,400
Everything just gets pulled to him.

532
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,280
Even you.

533
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,720
No.

534
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,160
No.

535
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,320
The only thing that pulled me in was you.

536
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,120
Being friends with your brother
is just a bonus.

537
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,240
That's good.

538
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,360
That's good. It's nice to come first
every once in a while.

539
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,840
Want to go for a drive?

540
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,120
-Yeah?
-The hijackers have hit again.

541
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,080
Bilkins has decided that we're gonna move
on Johnny Tran and his guys at 17:00.

542
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,000
Unless you say otherwise.

543
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,880
If you agree, just say yes.

544
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,360
-Yeah.
-Who is that?

545
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,200
qt's just a wrong number.

546
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,440
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but--

547
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,240
Yeah. Yes, sir.

548
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,800
Yeah. I got it.

549
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,960
The DVD players were purchased legally.

550
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:49,160
All we've got are a couple
of low-rent weapons charges...

551
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,440
...and some outstanding speeding tickets.

552
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,080
-So, they're out.
-Yeah.

553
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,840
Father bailed them out.

554
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,520
Is this the kind of intelligence
I can expect from you, O'Conner?

555
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,200
-You're gonna put this on me?
-I can put it on whoever I want to.

556
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,880
-Perks of the job.
-No, you can't put this on me--

557
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,760
No, wait a minute. Let me tell you.

558
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,880
I don't care if you have to aim at someone
and blow your cover to smithereens.

559
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,400
You've got 36 hours to crack this bastard...

560
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,440
...or you might want to think
about another career.

561
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,320
It's Toretto, Brian.
It always has been Toretto.

562
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,440
Tran and Hector are....

563
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,560
They're just fumes.

564
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,280
I know you've been lying to me.
My question is this:

565
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,880
Have you been lying to yourself
because you can't see past Mia?

566
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,280
He won't go back to prison.

567
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:58,000
Well, that's a choice
he's going to have to make.

568
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,200
There's all kinds of family, Brian.

569
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,280
And that's a choice
you're gonna have to make.

570
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,440
You ready for this?

571
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,520
Nice car.
What's the retail on one of those?

572
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,560
More than you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

573
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:05,960
Smoke him.

574
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,360
So, what's wrong, Brian?

575
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,920
Nothing, man, I'm fine.

576
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,480
Come on. Obviously something's off.

577
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,520
Look, I have my good days and bad days
just like anybody else.

578
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,640
Brian, don't lose that cool of yours.
That's your meal ticket.

579
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,240
My meal ticket?
I can't pay for my own shrimp?

580
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,800
I got the shrimp.

581
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,640
No, that's one thing about me
you don't understand.

582
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,280
I don't take handouts.
I earn my way, every step.

583
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,440
I need something extra on the side,
like you.

584
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,400
What do you mean, like me?

585
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,440
-What's that supposed to mean?
-That's what I mean.

586
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,120
-What does that mean, like me?
-Don't try--

587
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,200
I'm not stupid, all right?

588
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,520
I know that there's no way you paid
for all that shit you got under the hood--

589
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,800
There's no way you paid for
what's under the hood of those cars...

590
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,560
...by doing tune-ups and selling groceries.

591
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,240
Whatever it is you're in on,
I want in on it, too.

592
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:18,120
-Well, what is this?
-Read it.

593
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,120
-What is this for?
-It's directions.

594
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,680
To Race Wars.

595
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:26,880
We'll see how you go.

596
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,400
Then we'll talk.

597
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,360
-How's it going?
-What's up?

598
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,000
-Welcome to Race Wars.
-Great. Thanks a lot.

599
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,080
Baby. Hey, baby.

600
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,920
You should watch from the side.

601
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,400
I wouldn't want to get exhaust
on that pretty face.

602
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,400
-Put your money where your mouth is.
-I'll race you for that sweet little ass.

603
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,840
You want ass,
why don't you hit Hollywood Boulevard?

604
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,880
You want an adrenaline rush,
it'll be two large.

605
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:59,840
Right here. Right now.
What's it gonna be?

606
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,760
You got it.

607
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,920
"Another one bites the dust"

608
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:29,880
Come on. What you got?

609
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,000
See ya.

610
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,360
-What's up?
-Hey, what's up, Jesse?

611
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,000
What's in your hand?

612
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,400
Throwing down the pink slip, just like you.

613
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,000
-The pink slip to what? The Jetta?
-Yeah.

614
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:18,840
-You can't bet your dad's car.
-It's all right.

615
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,120
I ain't losing.

616
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,600
This fool is running a Honda 2000.
I'll win.

617
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:28,120
That way, me and my dad can roll
when he gets out of prison. It's all good.

618
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,640
They're gonna throw him right back
in prison after he kills you.

619
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,880
You visualize the win.

620
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,480
Visualize the win, Jesse. I'm serious.
You got to listen to me, man.

621
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,040
Who are you racing?

622
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,360
Jesse, don't do it.

623
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,000
I bet you he's got more than $100,000
under the hood of that car.

624
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,720
Too soon, junior.

625
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,000
No!

626
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,160
Shit!

627
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,920
Oh, God!

628
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,480
Yo! Heads up, bro. We got problems.

629
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,200
-What?
-Jesse.

630
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,640
Where's Jesse going?

631
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,160
-He just raced Tran for slips.
-Oh, shit.

632
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,320
-Where's he going?
-He went to the car wash.

633
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,440
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

634
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,560
Go fetch your car?

635
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,040
We're not on your block.

636
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,680
You better watch who you talk to like that.

637
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,240
Toretto!

638
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,240
SWAT came into my house...

639
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:26,240
...disrespected my whole family,
because somebody narked me out.

640
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,280
And you know what? It was you!

641
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,600
Get off of him, man.

642
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:05,280
Dom, chill out, man. Come on!

643
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,080
I never narked on nobody!

644
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,560
I never narked on nobody!

645
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,040
Mia.

646
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,880
I have respected you
and I haven't said shit.

647
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,600
Now I am asking you not to go.

648
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,480
-I'm doing this for both of us.
-Don't give me that crap.

649
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,960
You're doing this for you.

650
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:05,000
Why are you insisting on doing this?
Dom, please, just don't.

651
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,840
-Mia, what's going on?
-What?

652
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,320
-You know what I'm talking about.
-No, I don't.

653
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,560
You always have tears in your eyes
when Dom drives away?

654
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,160
What's the matter with you?

655
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,680
What's he racing off
in the middle of the night for?

656
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,840
-You know about the trucks?
-No, Brian! What trucks?

657
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,600
-Jesus Christ. What?
-Listen to me.

658
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,240
Mia, I'm a cop.

659
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,280
What are you talking about, Brian?
What is this?

660
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:45,640
Ever since the first time I met you,
I've been undercover.

661
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,000
I'm a cop.

662
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,440
Oh, you bastard.

663
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,360
You bastard.

664
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,400
-Mia.
-Get off of me, Brian!

665
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,160
Mia! Listen to me!

666
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,840
Everything I ever said
I felt about you was real.

667
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,480
I swear to God.
You have to believe me, Mia.

668
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,000
But this isn't about you and me.
Your brother's out there to pull a job.

669
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,400
We're running out of time. Those truckers
aren't laying down anymore.

670
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,120
Maybe they'll make it through tonight,
but every law enforcement agency...

671
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,840
...is coming down on them.

672
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,720
If you don't want anything to happen
to them...

673
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,760
...you have to get in that car
with me right now and help me.

674
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,440
Mia, you are the only person
that can help me right now.

675
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,400
Please, Mia. Please help me.

676
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,560
Civics are stashed somewhere
outside of Thermal.

677
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,760
They wouldn't double back,
and Highway 10 is too well patrolled.

678
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,720
-So, what does that leave us with?
-All this.

679
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,040
-Nextel.
-This is Officer Brian O'Conner.

680
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,400
Serial number 34762.
I need a cell phone trace.

681
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,480
-Okay. What's the cell number?
-Mia, what is it?

682
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,600
Come on, Mia.
She needs Dom's cell phone number now.

683
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,320
323-555-6439.

684
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,800
Thank you. Yeah, you get that?

685
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,640
All right, we're one man short.
Letty, I need you on the left side.

686
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,040
Your sister's right about this one.
This don't feel good.

687
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:11,120
-Don't do that.
-Something's wrong.

688
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,920
-Stop.
-We shouldn't be doing this without Jesse.

689
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,840
This is the mother lode.
We've been on this for three months.

690
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,280
After this, it's a long vacation for everyone.

691
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,280
-Let's go.
-I hope so.

692
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,640
Listen, the other night I had a dream...

693
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,720
...that you and I were
on the beach in Mexico.

694
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,040
-Really?
-Really.

695
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,120
Come on. Let's make this happen.

696
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:46,400
-Leon, keep on those scanners.
-Copy that.

697
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,800
All right, let's go.

698
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,920
Okay, we traced the number
to the northbound 86.

699
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,280
Mile 114, outside Coachella.
We'll keep the trace open, Officer.

700
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,000
Let me see this.

701
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,720
I think we're about 40 miles away.

702
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,720
What are you gonna do?

703
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,840
What are you gonna do?

704
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,800
Okay! Go time!

705
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,240
We're all good.
I got nothing on the scanners.

706
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,520
Keep going.

707
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:29,640
Vince!

708
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,240
Vince, don't! Get back in!

709
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,840
Vince!

710
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,920
He's got a damn shotgun! Leon!

711
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,200
Back off! Get him off of there!

712
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,960
Oh, shit!

713
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,160
Get me off this thing! Pull up!

714
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,440
Unhook yourself. Do it!

715
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,680
-Do it!
-I can't get--

716
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,120
You can do it!

717
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,520
Come on, Vince!

718
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:21,160
Dom! I'm pulling up to distract him!

719
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,760
Come on, boy!

720
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,960
Shot doesn't get better than this.

721
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,000
Son of a bitch!

722
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,880
Take me off here,
or I'll have to unhook the wire!

723
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,080
Try it again. One, two, three!

724
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,120
Unhook yourself!

725
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,600
I can't get my arm free!

726
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,800
-Vince, grab my hand!
-My arm!

727
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,640
Listen, give me your hand.

728
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,160
I'm gonna pull you off the rig!

729
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,760
Vince!

730
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,720
Hold on!

731
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,880
Give me your hand! Listen to me!

732
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:29,400
Dominic!

733
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,600
Shit!

734
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,080
-Dominic!
-Hang on!

735
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:39,440
Dom! Move out of the way.
I'm coming to get him.

736
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:04,800
Letty!

737
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,520
Leon!

738
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,680
Pull back for Letty.

739
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,960
Get her out of there!

740
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,440
I'm on it! Go!

741
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,800
I've got her! You get Vince off that truck.

742
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,040
Letty! Come on, baby.

743
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,120
You okay?

744
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,480
Oh, shit. Come on, girl, you all right?

745
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,040
Come on, let me look at you.
Come on. We got to go. Let's go.

746
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,720
Vince!

747
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,960
Take the wheel.

748
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,640
-What do you mean?
-Put your foot on the gas!

749
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,560
I'm gonna get him.
Put your foot on the gas!

750
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,840
Okay!

751
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,040
-Come on. Keep it steady.
-I got it!

752
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,400
All right, hold on, Vince.

753
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,960
He's having a hard time holding on.
Get me a little closer.

754
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:41,240
All right.

755
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:44,120
-Closer.
-I'm moving in.

756
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,040
Hold it right there!

757
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,880
Go!

758
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:52,400
You got to hang in here with me now!

759
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,560
We'll get you off. Give me your arm!

760
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,720
Vince, look at me! Don't let go!

761
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,000
Come on, Vince!
Throw this arm around me!

762
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,000
Vince, don't let go!

763
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,040
Come on, Mia. Get closer!

764
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,040
Mia, get closer! Come on.

765
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,920
Come on, Vince. Here we go!

766
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,040
Shit.

767
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,920
It's gonna be okay, Letty. I love you.

768
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,640
-Watch her.
-I got her.

769
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:03,960
Come on, Vince! Hang in there! Come on!

770
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,000
If he doesn't get to an ambulance
in 10 minutes, he's dead.

771
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,440
-Hold the pressure. Hold his arm up.
-I got it.

772
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,960
Yeah. Yeah, this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

773
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:24,520
I'm off-duty MAPD.

774
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,320
I need a life flight roll out right away.

775
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,520
My 20 is Highway 86, mile marker 147.

776
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,920
I got one trauma victim,
about 24 years of age.

777
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:38,480
Six-foot, maybe 200 pounds.

778
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:42,280
He's got a deep laceration to his right arm
with arterial bleeding.

779
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:46,560
And he's got a shotgun wound
close range to his left flank.

780
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,200
Yeah, he's going into shock!

781
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,000
Dom, put the gun down now!

782
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,240
-Move your car.
-No bullshit!

783
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,720
Put it down now! No more running!

784
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,320
I'm not running!

785
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,600
-Where's Leon and Letty?
-They're long gone!

786
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:44,600
Then it's over.
I didn't call the police, but don't push me!

787
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,520
-Put the gun down. I swear to God!
-You are the cop!

788
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:48,960
You're a cop!

789
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,680
Brian, I got to find Jesse before they do.

790
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,560
-I'm all the kid's got.
-I'll call in the plates.

791
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:00,160
PD will pick him up way before
Johnny even gets near him.

792
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,640
-Move your car.
-Dom, stop it! It's over. Please.

793
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,440
Mia, stay out of it!

794
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,800
Dominic, I am so sorry.

795
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,320
I don't know what I'm doing, Dom.

796
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:20,480
I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what's going on.

797
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,200
What were you thinking, man?

798
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,640
I don't know! I panicked! I'm sorry.

799
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,560
I'm scared!

800
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:30,640
I don't know what I'm doing!
Will you please help me?

801
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,440
Dom!

802
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,800
Jesse!

803
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,320
No, Jesse!

804
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,000
No, Dom, no!

805
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,920
Call 911. You call 911!

806
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:40,000
I used to drag here back in high school.

807
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:44,680
That railroad crossing up there
is exactly a quarter mile away from here.

808
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,320
On green, I'm going for it.

809
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,680
That's not what I had in mind.

810
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,160
You know what you're doing?

811
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,600
I owe you a 10-second car.

812
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:06,280
I live my life a quarter mile at a time.

813
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:09,400
Nothing else matters.

814
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,920
For those 10 seconds or less...

815
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:15,520
...I'm free.

816
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:26,080
