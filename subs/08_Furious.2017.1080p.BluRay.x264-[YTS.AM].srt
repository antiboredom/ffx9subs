Thanks...

Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

You told me
to round them up.

I didn't tell you
to hand...

519
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,516
Cut 'em loose. Oh, man.
This is embarrassing.

520
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,473
I'm sorry, guys,
really, I...

521
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,800
So, this is how
you treat old friends?

know who the hell this guy is.

523
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,600
Doesn't matter who I am, Tej.
I'm, like, nobody, okay?

524
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,989
Nobody. So, then,
who is he?

525
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,880
Him? He's nothing.
He's, like, less than me.

but I'm out.

Well, thanks
to your botched Berlin job,

you all made Interpol's
Top 10 Most Wanted list.

Top 10.
MR. NOBODY: Mmm-hmm.

533
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
That's all right.

534
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,594
Well, not you, Roman.
What do you mean?

535
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,035
You just missed the cut.
You're number 11, so...

536
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,231
I'm... I missed?
Yeah.

ROMAN: That's impossible!

538
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,800
What number did
they come in at?

539
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,197
Six, eight, nine, ten.

540
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,430
She's 10?
Mmm-hmm.

541
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,591
That's impossible.
There's no way she's a 10.

542
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,518
Oh, she's definitely a 10.
(SCOFFS)

543
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,434
How about we focus on someone who
we're not gonna find on anybody's list.

544
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,392
We're awaiting
hard confirmation,

545
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,360
but I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

546
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,397
Wait, no. Cipher's an organization.
Not a person.

547
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,760
Not according
to our sources.

548
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,950
What does she want?

549
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,150
No one knows.

550
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,431
Cipher is like
a digital act of God.

551
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,874
They... Well, she can manipulate
world systems from the shadows.

552
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,696
Anything that can be hacked
is hers to play with.

553
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,395
And here's the kicker.
You'll never find her linked to any of it.

554
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,711
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds, worldwide.

555
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,154
So, basically,
she's the bogeyman.

556
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,392
Damn, she's one of the hottest
bogeymans I've ever seen.

557
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,360
I mean, if y'all know her,
tell her to get at your boy.

won't mess with her.

this have to do with us?

interesting that,

565
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,798

for some reason,

Maybe we find Dom, huh?

572
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,669
Well, first,
let's catch him,

573
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,637
and then figure out
why he's turned.

574
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,799
So, y'all want us
to track Dom.

575
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,156
Yeah, I know, Roman,
it's kind of a big job.

576
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,710
It's impossible.

in an extra pair of hands.

a whole hell of a lot better.

you wanna tell me why

580
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,757
you just put me in a room with this
tea-and-crumpets eating, criminal sumbitch?

We are not teaming up
with this guy.

Let's get one thing clear.
I ain't on your team.

586
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,271
I don't care about you, your
crew, or your little family.

587
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,750
I'm here for Cipher.

588
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,896
What are you gonna do, apply for a job?
Head Asshole?

589

You know, I think that tight T-shirt's
cutting off the circulation to your brain.

590
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,189
You should get
a bigger size.

591
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,436
Cipher came to me first.
Wanted me to steal Nightshade for her.

592
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,056
When I said no,
she went after my brother.

593
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,311
Ah, yes, brother Owen.
Who could forget him, huh?

at a nasty
little black site prison.

596
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,431
Cipher corrupted him
and left him for dead.

597
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,816
So, if I get a shot
to take her down,

598
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,114
believe me, Flex,
I'm taking it.

599
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,176
You're taking my boot right up your
ass, is what you're taking.

600
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,953
Guys, guys. The fastest way to
find Cipher is through Toretto.

601
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,429
Now, aside from myself,
there's only two men in the world

602
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,976
that have ever managed to actually
track him down with any success.

603
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,799
And guess what. They're both
standing in front of me right now.

So, like it or not,
you two are gonna work together.

You got that?

606

I'm gonna take
that as a yes.

seeing this?

MR. NOBODY: And so, God's Eye
was where we started.

627
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,472
But Cipher's already
created an evasion

628
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,633
that masks their location by pinging
random spots all over the globe,

but it was
a good thought, Roman.

So, she's made
my program obsolete.

is why you're here.

You see, in order for God's Eye
to give off all these false pings,

01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,994
This is your doing.

1112
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,360
My doing?

1113
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,519
BABY TORETTO: (BABBLING)
Da-dada.

1114
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,954
Dada.

1115
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,555
Da-da.

1116
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,912
Please don't hurt him,
I'm begging you.

1117
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,355
I don't want you to beg.

1118
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,314
I want you to learn.

1119
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,040
Learn what?

1120
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:44,995
I understand why you did what you did.
I really do.

1121
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,795
Da-da.

1122
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,517
But it was
the wrong choice.

1123
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,869
This is the consequence
of that.

1124
01:22:58,640 --> 01:22:59,640
(MUFFLED SCREAMING) No!

1125
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,552
No! No!

1126
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:02,949
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1127
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,913
Save your son!

1128
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,395
No!

1129
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:08,680
(GUNSHOTS)

1130
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,439
(CRYING)

1131
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,394
(SHUSHING)

1132
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,875
(EXHALES)

1133
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,069
Can you pull up the footage
from the guy in the alley?

1134
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,870
Traffic cams.

1135
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,040
I got you.

1136
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,635
I knew it.

1137
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:47,394
I recognize that guy.

1138
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,589
That's Connor Rhodes.

1139
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,680
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

1140
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:55,070
He wanted us to get
the Nightshade device for him.

1141
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,675
Connor Rhodes.

1142
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,909
He's also linked to somebody
I'd quite like to forget.

1143
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,479
It's Mose Jakande.

1144
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,157
Warlord who tried
to get God's Eye.

1145
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,914
Which means that's twice that Dom
has messed up Cipher's business.

1146
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,233
Everything you're
feeling right now,

1147
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,233
this rage, a sense of
loss, it's not real.

1148
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:30,554
It's a survival instinct
wired deep into our brains

1149
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,314
to ensure continuation
of the species.

1150
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,990
When early man would
visit a watering hole,

1151
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,991
if they didn't
watch their child,

1152
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,469
and it got snatched
by a crocodile,

1153
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:49,550
our brains would create a
painful but instructional memory,

1154
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,752
so it would
never happen again.

1155
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,072
This idea of "family"
that is so core with you,

1156
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,998
that rules your world,

1157
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,593
it's a biological lie.

1158
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,078
You don't
have to accept it.

1159
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,555
I don't.

1160
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,512
Did you really think you
could destroy two of my teams

1161
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,352
without any repercussions?

1162
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,359
I wouldn't have even looked your
way if you hadn't done that.

1163
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,991
You didn't even know
you had a kid.

1164
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,916
You can thank me for that and start
doing the job I'm asking you to do.

1165
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,514
Help you start a war.

1166
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,512
Is that what
you think I want?

1167
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,474
That's so limited.

1168
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,077
I didn't take that football
to start a war

1169
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,879
any more than I took your
son to start a family.

1170
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,717
Taking your son
got me the codes.

1171
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,350
The codes will
get me the nukes

1172
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,795
and the nukes
will get me what I want

1173
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:56,397
today, tomorrow,
and every day after that.

1174
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,079
And what's that?

1175
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,469
Accountability.

1176
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,156
The second I fire off
one of those nukes,

1177
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:09,631
I put the superpowers
of this world on notice that,

1178
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,233
when they cross the line,

1179
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,229
I'm gonna be there
to hold them responsible.

1180
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:20,037
Because the truth is, Dom,

1181
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,113
to the world out there,

1182
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,674
I am the crocodile
at the watering hole.

1183
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:35,992
We've got one
last job to do.

1184
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:39,109
DOM: Cipher.

1185
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,959
If I were you,
I'd kiss my son.

1186
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:57,589
Because whether you value it or
not, all of this,

1187
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,756
your plane,
your security, and you,

1188
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,797
are still on this earth
because of him.

1189
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,456
RAMSEY: <i>The problem we've had with tracking
Cipher is there's nothing to trace.</i>

1190
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,920
But now,
we have Rhodes' information.

1191
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,838
And we're getting
snapshots of his data

1192
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,678
before it's
scrubbed off the net.

1193
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:20,136
That looks like somebody's
bank account,

1194
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,434
so why don't we
just go ahead...

1195
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,669
It's a longitude.

1196
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,630
Given the fact that
Dom hit a Russian motorcade,

1197
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:28,120
it's safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead and bring up the map.

1198
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,237
Good. Let's start here
and run the possibilities.

1199
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,674
Yalta, Poltava...

1200
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,440
It's like they just
threw letters together.

1201
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,555
Kronyurt.

1202
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:38,835
MR. NOBODY: It's "Vladovin."

1203
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,599
What are you doing here?
What?

1204
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,616
Told you I was gonna check
in on you from time to time

1205
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,640
to see how
you were doin'.

1206
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,154
By the way, not so hot.

1207
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,394
But there's nothing
in Vladovin. It's just ice.

1208
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,629
That's funny.

1209
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,896
Could've sworn there was a
secret Russian naval base

1210
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,831
where they retrofitted
Cold War submarines.

1211
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,230
Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.

1212
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:57,840
The base was taken over

1213
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,296
by a terror group of military
separatists about a month ago,

1214
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,000
and the Russians
haven't taken it back yet,

1215
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,270
so there is a little
window of opportunity here.

1216
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,875
Russian submarines.
Nuclear football.

1217
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,237
It sounds like everything we
do, our legs gonna be blown off.

1218
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,677
It sounds like you still number
11 on the list. (CHUCKLES)

1219
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,759
It sounds like
you've changed

1220
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,229
since your little punk-ass
facial hairs done came in.

1221
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:19,475
Guys, guys.

1222
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,870
Hey, we gotta call this in.
All the way up the chain.

1223
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,759
That's good thinking, champ,
except unfortunately,

1224
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,877
the Russian
Minister of Defense

1225
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,713
got himself involved in a
little incident on US territory,

1226
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,976
and the two governments aren't
talking to each other for a while.

1227
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,638
By the time they do,
it'll be too late.

1228
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,518
So, any other
suggestions?

1229
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,397
HOBBS: Yeah. I got one.

1230
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,112
How about we just
stop them ourselves?

1231
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,077
You're talking about
a Russian military base.

1232
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:44,309
Separatist.

1233
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,470
Whatever.
It's suicide.

1234
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,039
It's stopping World War III.

1235
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,230
What's it gonna be, rook?

1236
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,831
You gonna close your
eyes on this one, too?

1237
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,440
Pray that
the apocalypse doesn't come

1238
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,954
knocking on your
mama's front door?

1239
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,990
Or, are you gonna
saddle up, be a man,

1240
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,594
and save the entire
goddamn world?

1241
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,035
You know,
I think I figured it out.

1242
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:11,475
What's that?

1243
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,517
Rule number three.
Which is?

1244
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,115
There are no rules.

1245
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,395
(MR. NOBODY LAUGHS)

1246
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,598
What'd I tell you, Luke?
I knew he'd get it in three.

1247
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:23,376
LITTLE NOBODY: Aerial
transport leaves in an hour.

1248

Take whatever vehicle you want.
All bets are off.

1249
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,878
All bets are off?
Bets are off?

<i>Do svidanya!</i>

1251
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,920
Letty, I don't like
telling you this one bit.

1252
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:58,754
But the game's changed.

1253
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:02,153
Before, we were just trying to catch
Dom, but now, after all this,

1254
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,152
I want you to know,
if I have to,

1255
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,755
I'm gonna put him down.

1256
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,440
Then you might have
to take us both down.

1257
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,434
ROMAN: I'm freezing, man.

1258
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:16,400
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
This ain't for me.

1259
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:19,194
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle, brah.

1260
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:24,830
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with it.

1261
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,999
I tried to take a piss,
I didn't even recognize myself.

1262
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,670
Man, that's entirely
too much information.

1263
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:33,910
I'm just sayin'.

1264
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,753
Well, one thing's

a party favor.

1742
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,616
(MR. NOBODY LAUGHS)
HOBBS: This can't be good.

1743
02:03:32,640 --> 02:03:35,154
Your record's been cleared.
Full reinstatement.

1744
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:36,799
You've got your job back.

1745
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:38,359
That is, if you want it.

1746
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:42,915
If I want?

1747
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Mmm-hmm.

1748
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,673
(LAUGHS)

1749
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:54,673
You know, after 16 years,
I figure it's time for a little break.

1750
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:56,469
Wow.

1751
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:59,997
Daddy's stayin' home.

1752
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,669
(LAUGHS)

1753
02:04:06,520 --> 02:04:07,555
Nobody.

1754
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:08,675
Keep in touch.

1755
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:10,719
Ah. Hang on a second.

1756
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:13,230
This could be interesting.

1757
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:19,640
(SIGHS) What made
you think I'd do it?

1758
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:21,794
Brotherhood.

1759
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:25,510
I saw that look you gave
Cipher, knew you wanted revenge.

1760
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:27,319
Glad I did it.

1761
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:33,149
I can't believe
you went to see my mother.

1762
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:36,430
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

1763
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:50,471
All this fuss over you.

1764
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:52,434
(COOING)

1765
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:57,914
Yes.

1766
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:06,072
Elena, I promised
to keep our son safe.

1767
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:10,436
And now,
he always will be.

1768
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:22,838
I wanna introduce you to the most
important person in my universe.

1769
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,909
One who never gave up on me.

1770
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:33,670
He's beautiful.

1771
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:37,033
DOM: <i>You've heard me say</i>

1772
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,790
that you never turn
your back on family,

1773
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,799
and I wanna thank you all for
never turning your back on me.

1774
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:51,953
You wanna meet them?

1775
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:54,119
All right.

1776
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,280
Everyone,

1777
02:05:57,640 --> 02:05:59,039
meet Brian.

1778
02:06:00,120 --> 02:06:01,952
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

1779
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,920
(COOING)

1780
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:09,549
HOBBS: To Brian!

1781
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:11,517
ROMAN: Welcome
to the family, Brian.

1782
02:06:11,600 --> 02:06:14,319
Okay, I guess
it's my turn to say grace.

1783
02:06:14,760 --> 02:06:17,274
We thank you
for giving us family.

1784
02:06:17,360 --> 02:06:21,752
We sit here in praise.
Thank you for giving us the strength...
