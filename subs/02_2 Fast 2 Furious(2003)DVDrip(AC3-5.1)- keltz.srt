1
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,880
Go! Go!

2
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,960
Yo, Jimmy, man,
give me the status.

3
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,080
Tell me we good.
We got it, man.

4
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,400
Beautiful.
It's gonna be
an all-timer tonight.

5
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,200
All right,
all right, all right.
Fire 'em up!

6
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,200
We go live in five.

7
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,680
It's time for ignition
and straight automobile pimp.

8
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,120
Let's do it, man.
Let's go.

9
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,560
Ow, girl!
Sorry! My bad!

10
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,240
All right, ladies!
We're good!

11
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,920
We're good.

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,400
That's it, babies.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
Come on, Tej.
Let's get this race going!

14
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
Whoa, whoa, man.
Wait a second, man.

15
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,040
You cats are first wave, man.
Where's your fourth at?

16
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,760
Yo, it was Joaquin, but he had
to work the graveyard shift.
What?

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,360
Graveyard shift, man?
Yo, why don't you
run with us, Tej?

18
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,480
Hell, no, I'm not runnin'
with y'all, man.

19
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,840
Either you find a fourth
or you don't race.

20
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
- How 'bout that, huh?
- We should find two...

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,280
so we don't have to roll
with skirt here.

22
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,040
Oooh!
Idiota.

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,520
Whoa. Whoa.
Wait a second.

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,240
Why don't I just find y'all
a fourth and we settle
this on the streets, huh?

25
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,400
- Bring him on.
- Anybody I want?

26
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,880
- No matter who it is.

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,360
Yeah.
Yeah, man.
You wanna race tonight?

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,040
- Yeah. You know
I could use the money.
- You got four minutes.

30
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,680
- All right. I'll be there.

31
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,600
The race starts
in four minutes.

32
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,960
All right, girls.
Let's do this.

33
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,440
*2 furious
I'm too fast for y'all, man *

34

*Drah, 2 fast

35
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,000
*I'm too fast

36
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,680
You think
you gonna win baby?
What you think?

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
You better.
We got rent to pay.
I know this.

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,720
* You just came home
from doin'a bid *

39
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,840
* Tell me what ya gonna do *
*Act a fool *

40
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,000
*Somebody broke in
and cleaned out your crib *

41
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,040
*Boy, what you gonna do *
*Act a fool *

42
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,040
*Man, that ain't sticky
That's sticks and stems *

43
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,440
*Boy, what you gonna do *
*Act a fool *

44
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,040
*2 fast, 2 fast
2 furious, 2 furious **

45
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,440
I'll get you when
you get a car worth racing.

46
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,760
Yeah. There's
our fourth right there.

47
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,160
- Shit. It's Brian.

48
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,440
Yeah, Brian.!
I love you, Bullet.!

49
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,640
What's up, Tej?
What's happenin', dude?

50
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,640
Thanks for the invite.
No problem at all, man.
Just, uh...

51
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Just remember me
when you wax, right?

52
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,400
They got deep pockets?
Real deep.

53
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,560
- What's up, Suki?
- What's up, Bullet?

54
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,320
- What do you say
we kick it a nickel?

55
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,680
Nobody said nothin'
about raisin' the stakes.

56
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,480
If that's the case,
why don't you ask
these nice people here...

57
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,200
to back off the line
so you can go home?
Oooh.!

58
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,920
Hey. Hey. Hey.

59
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,120
Okay. Thirty-five large.

60
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,760
Three cinco.

61
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,400
Thirty-five large, huh?

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,280
Either that or you
can go home, brah.

63
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,480
Yeah.

64
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,760
- It's all there.
- It better be.

65
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,240
Damn, Suki.
Uh, when you gonna
pop my clutch, huh?

66
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,080
As soon as you
get the right
set of tools.

67
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,600
Yeah, right.

68
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,160
All right, back up.
Back up. Let's go. Let's go.

69
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,080
Whoa!

70
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,080
Back y'all asses up.
Back up. Back up.

71
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,160
Before you turn
into barbecue around here.

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,400
It's not a game.
This is serious.

73
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,120
All right. Back up. Back up.
Get off the street.

74
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,080
Let's go. Back it up.
Back it up.

75
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,480
Everybody keep your hands
real, real clear, all right?

76
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,520
'Cause I got a surprise
for y'all this evening.

77
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,160
Go, SlapJack!
Go, baby!
I got this. I got this.

78
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,200
Ready.

79
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,320
Ready.

80
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,280
Ready.

81
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,560
Ready.

82
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,360
Go!

83
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,160
- Oh, hell, no!

84
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,560
Aaah!

85
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,960
Aha!

86
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
You ain't passin' me, dawg.
You ain't passin' me. Come on!

87
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,440
What you got, man?

88
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,480
I told you
you weren't gonna pass me.

89
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,360
- Move, bitch!
- Ha!

90
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,680
Pendeja.!

91
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,400
Uh-uh. Not tonight, baby.

92
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,800
Bend over, boy.

93
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,480
Damn, girl!

94
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,960
Last turn. Last turn.

95
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh, too wide!

96
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Home stretch, baby!

97
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,120
Whoo-h-h-hoo!
Let it go, dawg!

98
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,760
Yes!

99
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,400
I can smell you!

100
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,080
Yo, Jimmy,
hit it, baby. Hit it!

101
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,320
Right. Y'all see that?

102
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,360
Told y'all
I had a surprise.

103
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,920
How you like that
for a finale?

104
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,760
Bridge.

105
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,520
- Oh!
- Whoo-hoo!

106
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah!

107
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,360
Shit!

108
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,840
Huh? Oh, hell, no!

109
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,760
Whoo! Smack that ass!

110
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,840
Yes!

111
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,320
Tell me y'all saw that, man.
Bullet and Suki sprayed
the bridge,

112
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,040
and I need to start
making y'all pay
to see this shit.

113
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,200
I got over 10 stacks
for my man right here, right?

114
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,240
That's what
I'm talkin' about, man.
Play with it.

115
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,680
Smells good, don't it?
Yeah, I'll buy that.
Right there.

116
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,080
Right. Y'all see this?
Everybody take
a real good look.

117
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,280
This what you call
mutual respect.
Right, let's clear out.

118
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,720
Anybody down
for another race?

119
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,760
Shit!

120
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,360
Hey, uh, make sure
you bring that body
by the garage later, right,

121
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,600
so, you know,
we can work on
that front end of yours.

122
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,600
Watch out.
'Cause maybe I will.

123
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,560
Yeah.

124
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,520
What's up, man?

125
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,880
Hey, where you going?

126
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,560
It's time
to get out of here.
Why's that?

127
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, shit!

128
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,600
Nissan Skyline. Got him.

129
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,720
Shit! Shit!

130
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,000
Shit...

131
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Shit.

132
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,640
Damn!

133
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
Let me see your hands!
Put 'em up!

134
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,880
This is him. We got him.!

135
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,040
So, how long you been
in south Florida?
A while.

136
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,040
Before that?

137
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,480
We know you're
Brian O'Conner,
formerly of the L.A.P.D.

138
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,680
- You've got the wrong guy.
- Really?

139
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,840
How you doin, O'Conner?

140
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,040
Let's take a walk.

141
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,160
Carter Verone.
Born in Argentina.

142
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,560
But he's lived
most of his life in Miami.

143
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,200
Now he owns
the biggest import/ export
business in the state.

144
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,400
Unfortunately, the cartels
have been successful
getting drugs into Miami.

145
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
But they've had
a hard time gettin'
the cash out.

146
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,520
We've been
surveilling him for a year,
but we've never been able...

147
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,440
to put him
and the money together.

148
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,720
- We've swept his house,
his warehouses...
- Nothing.

149
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,400
Customs here has done
a great job of getting us
this far.

150
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,640
I'm just here to help get
them over the top.

151
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
I was able to get
an agent in undercover...

152
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,760
working travel
and logistics for him.

153
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,800
Recently, Verone put her
in charge of finding
some new drivers.

154
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,840
Right. Although we can't
confirm her status right now.
You think she's flipped?

155
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,080
She's one of mine.
She's all right.

156
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,600
She's been in with Verone
nearly a year. Even lives
at the compound with him now.

157
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,720
Look, it was the F.B.I.'s idea
to bring you in here.

158
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,040
I'm against it. But we need
some good drivers...

159
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,240
that can put this asshole
and his money together.

160
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,160
You're gonna roll
with Agent Dunn here.

161
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
And if I don't?

162
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,240
Well, here's a list
of the laws you broke in L.A.

163
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,080
Obstruction of justice,
aiding and abetting.
You know the rap sheet.

164
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,600
Now, we can make this
all go away in the interest
of justice,

165
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,280
if you're willing
to play ball.
Yeah.

166
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,480
So what's the idea here?
Dunn and I are supposed
to be street racers?

167
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,760
That's right.

168
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,680
So, Dunn...

169
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,600
Looks like we're gonna
be partners, bro.

170
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,840
Could you tell me right quick
what would be a better motor
for my Skyline,

171
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,720
a Gallo 12 or a Gallo 24?

172
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,760
Um...
The 24.

173
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,040
I didn't know
pizza places made motors.

174
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,160
See, man, come on.
I can't do this.

175
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,240
Seriously,
if this is what
you're gonna give me,

176
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,360
I may as well
take my chances in Chino.

177
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,880
We will
get someone else.

178
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,080
No way, man.

179
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,280
The only way I'll do this is
if I get to pick the driver.

180
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,000
All right, O'Conner,
who you got in mind?

181
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,360
This dude I grew up with
in Barstow.

182
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,720
Who's that?
Roman Pearce.

183
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,840
Hi-oh! What...

184
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,280
- That's your boy
in the Monte Carlo?
- Yeah, that's him.

185
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,320
Yeah, he's got some skills.
Mm-hmm.

186
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,240
And he's crazy as hell,
I'm telling ya.

187
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,840
In a good way though.
He's the man for the job.

188
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,800
He's got quite a record,
including three years upstate.

189
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,880
Says here he's on
house arrest now. Can't go more
than 100 yards from his home.

190
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,400
Roman Pearce.!

191
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Whoo-hoo.!

192
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,680
He always said
he'd be famous.

193
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,480
Pearce.!

194
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,280
Roman Pearce!

195
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,680
- Yo, whatever happens next,
just let it go.
- I ain't in it.

196
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,400
Rome!

197
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
Only my homeboys
call me Rome, pig!

198
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,040
- I'm not a cop anymore, bro.
- Is that true?

199
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,520
- Blondie here's
not a cop anymore?
- That's true. No badge.

200
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,320
Whoo! Here we go.

201
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,240
You still fight like shit.
You still fight like shit...

202
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,320
You better chill.

203
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,000
What the hell
are you doin' here, O'Conner?
I'll choke you.

204
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
I told you
to stay away from...

205
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,200
You should've told me.
I did three years, Brian.

206
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,400
I told you
it wasn't my fault.

207
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,480
Why did you
come here, O'Conner?

208
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,200
I got a deal for you.

209
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,560
When I needed your ass,
you were nowhere to be found.

210
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,160
Now you tryin'
to hand out deals?

211
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,200
I need you
to come to Miami
and drive with me.

212
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,480
If you do, they'll take off
that anklet and they'll
clear your entire record.

213
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,480
I did three years in jail.

214
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,520
Three years in jail
off you, Brian.

215
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,840
I know you better
than you think.

216
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,080
Maybe you don't.
Maybe you don't.

217
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,800
You guys finished?

218
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,840
This deal legit?

219
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,600
That's right, if you
do this job for us.

220
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,040
Told you.
Shut up, punk.

221
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,320
So you gonna clean
my record and get this
thing off my ankle?

222
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,280
That's right. I thought you
couldn't wander more than
100 yards from your home.

223
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,760
Why do you think
I'm parked so close
to the derby?

224
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,800
Man, quit playin' like
you gonna pass this up.

225
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,320
Wait. Hold up.

226
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,480
Hey, bro,
what's going on?

227
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,280
I don't know
if I should be
trusting you, man.

228
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Just think of it this way.
It's an opportunity
for a fresh start.

229
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,760
Let's just go do this.
I wouldn't need
a fresh start...

230
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,040
if it weren't for you.
Man, you been using that
since the day you got busted.

231
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,720
Now, let's just chill out
and go do this.
I don't need to chill out.

232
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,920
Yes, you do. And you
need to stop blaming me
for your every mistake.

233
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,160
And Roman Pearce needs
to start taking responsibility
for his own actions.

234
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,720
You need to go to hell.
And you need
to go back to Barstow.

235
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,640
I'm not goin'
back to Barstow.

236
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,920
Brian O'Conner,
Roman Pearce,
meet Monica Fuentes.

237
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,480
- Do they have
background on Verone?
- They've been briefed.

238
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,920
Good. All right,
here's the deal.

239
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,840
Verone's looking for drivers.
I've arranged for
both of you to join up.

240
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,320
I've also hired some thugs.
You know, to make it legit.

241
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,640
- When do we start?
- Right now.

242
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,760
- What are we drivin'?

243
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,840
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

244
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,160
Don't even think about
takin' the convertible.

245
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,280
It might
loosen your mousse.

246
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,960
No, that's cool.
That's too much
chrome for me anyways.

247
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,440
Damn! Where you all confiscate
these rims from, man?

248
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,880
Check in with us
after you meet him.

249
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,640
You gonna have any problems
with these two knuckleheads?
I can handle 'em.

250
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,280
They give you any trouble
at all, you let me know.
Thanks, Markham.

251
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,280
I'll ride with you,
cowboy.

252
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,560
Why she gotta ride with you.
You get the convertible.
Let's go.

253
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,840
* That's where I reside *

254
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,160
* That's where I'll represent
till I die *

255
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,120
*So get changed
and put your drinks down *

256
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,480
*And get sexed up
and get wowed for tonight *

257
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,880
*Pit bull like a sex bull
like the next truck
Mama, you got the next *

258
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,800
Turn right here.

259
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,800
So you used to be a cop?
Yeah.

260
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,720
How long you been under?

261
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,160
I lost track.

262
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,080
You all right?

263
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,320
You might wanna keep
your eyes on the road, playboy.

264
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,480
What, you think
we're gonna crash?
I haven't decided yet.

265
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,600
What are you doin', Brian?

266
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,400
He did the "stare and drive"
on you, didn't he?

267
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,800
He got that from me.

268
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,840
*Represent your county
your city *

269
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,520
* Who you know
pull Chevys like this *

270
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,520
* Can't he pace with a trunk
in a funk like this *

271
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,640
* With the loose top *

272
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,880
*And the rims keep spinnin'
even when I stop *

273
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,480
*Murder one, I'll be chillin'
Got everybody watchin'
but who gonna stop me *

274
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,280
* The first game, soda *

275
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,720
*Somebody tries some mo'shit
buys some mo'shit *

276
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,560
*I "T"doubled 'em
switched the game *

277
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,240
* Got next slope down
switchin'lanes *

278
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,960
* Chevy boys, we like it fast
so I drop it in low
heavy on the gas **

279
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,360
Once we get in here,
you're on your own.

280
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,480
Look at that one.

281
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,160
Hey, where did you
get them cars, the bottom
of a cereal box?

282
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,760
Eh! Real funny, Fonzie.

283
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,760
Ass.

284
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,520
Roberto, Enrique,
I need pictures of
the drivers,

285
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,200
their license plates,
their cars, and anything else
you can find.

286
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,440
Let's go.

287
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,640
Keep your mouth shut
and follow my lead, all right?

288
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,680
I got this.
No, I'm serious now.

289
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,800
Handle your business.
I'll handle mine.

290
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,960
Watch your hands, brah.

291
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,280
Go in line.
Let's go.

292
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
Carter.

293
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,320
Drivers are here.
Good.

294
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,960
Come on.

295
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,120
Stay.

296
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,520
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

297
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,160
My red Ferrari was confiscated
yesterday, and it sits in
an impound lot in Little Haiti.

298
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
It's about
20 miles from here.

299
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,640
The car isn't important.
What is important is the package
I left in the glove box.

300
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,360
The first team back here
with the package will have
an opportunity to work for me.

301
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,800
- What, we gotta audition?
- Nobody's got a gun
to your head.

302
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,240
That's it.

303
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
Driver's licenses.
Pass 'em up.

304
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Before Christmas, guys.
Go!

305
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,960
Go! Go, man.
Come on. Go!

306
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,240
Come on, cuz.

307
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,400
All right,
let's see what
this thing can do.

308
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,760
Agent Markham,
I've got 'em
heading south on l-95.

309
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,720
Yeah, I got it.

310
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,840
They're running.
What a surprise.

311
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,120
Come on. Stick with me, Rome.
What you got?

312
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,640
Why must I chase the cat?

313
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,880
Smart ass.

314
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,720
- Oh, yeah? You think
you're the bomb, Rome?

315
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,840
Let's see if
you still got it, Brian.

316
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,360
All right, Rome.
I got somethin'
for your ass.

317
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,360
Watch this, bro.

318
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,280
Shit.

319
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,600
Yeah, Rome.
How do you like
them apples?

320
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,120
Show off!

321
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,360
That's the Brian O'Conner
school of driving
right there, baby.

322
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
Crazy-ass white boy!

323
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,400
Oh, shit!

324
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,560
- Hey, man.
- Huh?

325
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,520
Get yourself on
outta the street.!

326
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,840
Boy, that's some
bad shit, man.

327
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,200
What do we got?

328
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,800
That's good.
Show me his partner.

329
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,640
Cars. Cars.
Where are the cars?

330
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,840
Stinkin' boats.
Where are the cars?

331
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,880
I need the cars.
Where are the cars at?

332
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,320
Look in the center.
Look in the center.
What?

333
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,120
Chi-ching! Now put
your blouse back on.
Hater.

334
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,280
Shit.!

335
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,840
- Don't let 'em get away.
- Not a problem.

336
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,480
Sit on it, Fonzie!

337
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,120
- What the hell?

338
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,800
Aw, shit! Cops.

339
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,680
- What the hell
they doin' here?
- Rome, no.!

340
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,760
Time to go.

341
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,800
- Son of a bitch!
Juvie record for popping cars.

342
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,560
Two years in J.D.,
then another year for aiding
and abetting an armed robbery.

343
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,400
He's clean.
Dirty but clean.

344
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,520
Hm. All right.

345
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,760
Hey, man, you got
somethin'to eat
up in there? We hungry.

346
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,640
Sit 'em by the pool.
Mm-hmm.

347
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,120
Nice. Come on.

348
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,800
Hmm.
What you checking
her out for?

349
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,360
I'm not
checking her out.

350
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,160
Yes, you were.
No, I wasn't.

351
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,720
I seen you
checkin' her out, man.
Okay, I was. Now shut up.

352
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,160
You shut up.
Don't tell me to shut up.

353
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,200
Both you girlies
shut up.

354
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,440
Unbelievable.

355
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,840
All right.

356
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,320
You sure are cozy
in this big ol' mansion.

357
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,080
Sleepin' with
the enemy.

358
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,440
No, no, no.
Sit down.

359
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,640
Nice Ferrari
you got in the driveway.

360
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm glad you like it.

361
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,040
Darlin',
will you hold that?

362
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,600
We did all that
for a damn cigar?

363
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,160
No, you did that
for a job.

364
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,640
Do you really think
that I would let
somebody impound my car?

365
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,880
The boatyard's mine.
Oh, by the way,

366
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,480
you two owe me a gate.

367
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,720
- But I'll just
take it off your cut.

368
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,880
Off our cut. Yeah.

369
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,200
- I like that.
- Good.

370
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,120
What's this job
you got for us anyway?

371
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,920
Come with me.

372
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,200
The house has ears in it.

373
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,000
I have something I want you
to carry from North Beach
to the Keys.

374
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,080
What is it?
Just put in the car
what I tell you to,

375
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,720
drive it to me
and don't let anyone
stop you, understand?

376
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,360
Yeah. Any chance
of cop trouble?

377
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,920
No. I'm buying you
a window of time, but it's
not gonna be open very long.

378
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,520
You make it,

379
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,240
and I'll personally hand you
100 G's at the finish line.

380
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,800
Make it 100 G's
a piece, papi.

381
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,080
Look, man, obviously,

382
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,000
your pockets
ain't nervous.
Hey, hey, hey.

383
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,440
Don't ever touch me.

384
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,560
Ours are empty.

385
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,000
Like I said,
we hungry.

386
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,520
I got an idea.

387
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,040
Why don't you two boys
join us at the club
a little later tonight?

388
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,600
- Yeah. Pearl at midnight?
- We'll get to know
each other a little better.

389
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,760
All right.
Sounds good.

390
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,400
We'll see you tonight.
See ya.

391
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,680
Hey, you!

392
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,000
Your pockets aren't empty.

393
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,560
- Damn.
- I'll take my cutter back.

394
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,520
Stupid ass.

395
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,640
Hey, man,
I figured you
had, like, 12 or 13...

396
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,480
You're not too bright,
are you?
Just get out of here.

397
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,960
Same old Rome
doin' the same old
stupid shit.

398
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,760
Get off me, man.
What, runnin' your mouth?
Insultin' people?

399
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,680
Stealin' Verone's shit?

400
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,880
Think I'm gonna let
somebody stare me down?

401
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,720
I didn't let nobody
stare me down in jail,
homeboy.

402
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Think I'm gonna
let it fly on a beach?

403
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,560
And you, I'll take
my cutter back.

404
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,600
His rich ass.

405
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,240
And you're packin'!
Like you ain't?

406
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,560
Exactly.

407
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,200
- From here, I do the talkin'.
- Looks like you wanna do
a little more than that.

408
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,120
Oh, and what's that
supposed to mean?

409
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,120
It means you always
gettin' in trouble
over a female, Brian.

410
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,520
Man, Tej's garage is ridiculous.
He's got the best of everything.

411
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,840
Snap-on tools. All these lifts
are brand-new. They're only
maybe a couple months old.

412
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,720
Hey, yo, Jimmy.
What's up, man?

413
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,640
What up, Bullet?
That's Rome right there.

414
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,800
When you get a second,
I want you to check out...

415
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,040
the Evo and the Spyder
and make sure
everything's copecetic.

416
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,000
Evo? Where'd you get
an Evo from?

417
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,200
Well, it's
a long story.
I got you, man.

418
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,120
All right,
thanks, Jimmy.
Come check this out.

419
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,000
It's so hot and humid
out here, I can't even
wear no drawers.

420
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,720
Yeah, tell me about it.
Look at all
this potential out here.

421
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,400
Don't do that, man.

422
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,000
Damn!

423
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,160
Damn. Baby.

424
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,440
Girl, you know
your boy can help
you put that fire out.

425
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,720
Look at the bubble
on that...

426
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,000
That's cool.
That's serious right there.

427
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,960
You're making me lose money.
Don't do that to me right now.

428
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,080
I cannot take that right...
Come on, Ray! Do it!

429
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
Hey, Tej Parker,

430
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,720
Roman Pearce.

431
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,600
Come on, baby...
Basically, he's the man
to know in Miami.

432
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,640
He's got his finger
in absolutely everything.

433
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,600
It's just
the way it is.

434
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,520
What's goin' on, Suki?
What's up, baby?

435
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,640
How you doing?
I'm good.
How you doing?

436
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,600
What's this?
What's the latest?
It's a work in progress.

437
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,200
It's not finished yet.
That's some artistic shit.

438
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,840
You got talent, girl.
Yeah, she's good.
She's the best.

439
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,720
Do or die. Bring it home, Ray.
Bring it home, Ray.
Bring it home. Bring it home.

440
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,320
Yeah, baby! Pay up!
Pay up! Pay up!

441
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,480
That's how they
do it out here, man?

442
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,880
Every day.
That's crazy.

443
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,680
Right here, right now.
What's up, man?
You don't look too happy.

444
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,240
Right? Expeditiously, man.
I need it quick right here.
What's up?

445
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,880
Thank you.
Thank you. All right.
How you feeling? Right?

446
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,880
Right.
Thank you.
Thank you, man.

447
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,280
Not too bad.
Whoo!

448
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,120
I'll see you
about your money, homey.
You race too?

449
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,240
No, man.

450
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,520
I hit a wall doin',
like, a buck 20
couple years ago, you know?

451
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,120
Ever since then,
I just been organizing
and collecting, man.

452
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,800
Tej, check it out.
He's gonna be in town
for a while.

453
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,440
Is there anyway
he could use that cot?

454
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,360
What's wrong
with your place, man?

455
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,360
No, I don't
wanna stay with him.
He got bad habits.

456
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,840
right, man.
Whatever, man.

457
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,480
Show him around
real quick, right?
I'll be up there in a minute.

458
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,040
Thanks.

459
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,000
right, who want a chance
to win their money back?

460
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,760
What's up, Jimmy?
So you ever seen
anything like this before?

461
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,800
No. Both of them
are wired up
like I never seen before.

462
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,800
What?
Yeah, man. They got us
wired with G.P.S.

463
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,680
That's why Markham
knew we were gonna be
at that impound lot.

464
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,840
Yo, you the master mechanic.
Why don't you just yank
that shit up out of there?

465
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,120
I'll try, but
this ain't LoJack.

466
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,520
The D.I.S. Box,
the engine management system,
hell, the main harness...

467
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,440
The G.P.S. Is spidered
into all of that.

468
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,280
Hey, tell me somethin', man.
Do I even want to know
where the Skyline is, dawg?

469
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,240
Or where you been
the past couple of days?

470
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,640
Or where the hell
you got these rides from?
They're hot.

471
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,040
Yeah, they hot. They wired
so hot that whoever's trackin'
these things will know...

472
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,960
every time you don't
wear your seat belt.

473
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,440
All right, Jimmy,
just do what
you can do, bro.

474
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,760
- I got ya.
- Thanks, man.

475
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,080
Man, we need to get
these on the street ASAP.

476
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,520
Hey, bro,
check it out.

477
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,920
You see that Cadillac
across the street
over there?

478
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,680
Yeah.
Yeah, well, they've been on us
since we left Verone's house.

479
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,880
Elian and Fidel!

480
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,840
Hey, man, I'll clean
your windshield for you.

481
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,960
- What are you doin', man?

482
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,320
Uno, tres, cuatro,
"fourtro," taco.

483
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,800
Everything's copecetic, homey.

484
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,600
Kiss my ass, putos.

485
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,480
Shit!

486
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,640
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

487
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,440
He's gonna blow our cover
before we even get started.

488
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,760
Hey, Bilkins, can you
tell me what went wrong?
That's what I wanna know.

489
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,800
Show me your hands!
Come on. Keep 'em up!

490
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,640
- What's this about, man?
- Hey, w-what's goin' on?

491
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,400
Hold this.
You think you can shoot at me?
I'm a goddamn federal agent!

492
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,360
What are you talkin' about?
Get your damn hands off me!
Get him away from me!

493
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,680
Just 'cause you wear a badge
don't mean you can come in
and mess shit up.!

494
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,400
- Get your hands off of me!
- You're lucky
I didn't shoot you.

495
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,960
- Shut up, Rome!
- Don't tell me
to shut up, Brian!

496
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,760
You almost blew our cover,
old man.

497
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,120
You shouldn't have
shown up like you did.

498
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,240
What, you didn't know
Verone was testing us?

499
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,520
- No. I thought you punks
were running.
- Running!

500
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,480
That's great.
That's real great!

501
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,720
Oh, and if Rome wanted
to shoot you, you wouldn't
be here right now.

502
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,640
All right.
We gotta get this
under control.

503
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,720
Hey, that's mine.!

504
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,520
- So?
- So tell me what you know.

505
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,080
Well, Rome and I will be
making a run for Verone.

506
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,600
I'm not sure when and where.
But he did say
he bought us a window.

507
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,160
I'm assuming
from the local cops.

508
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,040
I can talk to
some of the guys
at the local P.D.

509
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,120
No. No good. If Verone's got
some of them on the payroll,

510
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,120
then we can't let them know
our operation.

511
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,560
Exactly. In addition,

512
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,120
Verone told us that he himself
would be waiting at the drop.

513
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,480
That's good news.
If you're gonna be
delivering drug money to him,

514
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,000
- then we can get him
for laundering.
- No, there's only one problem.

515
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,720
- What's that?
- Fuentes...
Verone's tappin' her.

516
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,880
Tappin' her?
Tappin' her how?
That is crap!

517
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,280
What you talkin' about,
homeboy? We know what we seen.

518
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,040
What do you think, O'Conner?
You think she's compromised?

519
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,720
- You should know.
- What's that supposed to mean?

520
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,600
What? You mean your old pal
O'Conner didn't tell ya?

521
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,200
He flipped on Bilkins in L.A.
Gave his mark his car keys
and let him disappear.

522
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,760
That's why he's not
a cop anymore.

523
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,560
So what do you think, expert?

524
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,600
Man, I don't know.

525
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,080
All right.
We'll keep an eye on her.

526
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,880
We're out of here.

527
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,520
You let your man go, huh?
Drop it. I don't
wanna talk about it.

528
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,600
Drop it, hell!
I wanna hear
about this, homey.

529
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,120
I said forget about it, cuz.

530
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,080
We got Fuentes in with Verone,
Markham tryin'
to blow our cover...

531
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,160
and we got two wired cars
that are no better than that
damn ankle bracelet of mine.

532
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm-a tell you, brah.
You let your man Markham do that
shit again in front of Verone,

533
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,480
- that's gonna be our ass.
- I know, man. I know.

534
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,200
It's gettin' thick real quick,
and we may need a way out.

535
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,760
- We gotta come up with
some exit strategy.
- Exit strategy, huh?

536
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,720
Yeah.

537
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,200
I like the way that sounds.
What you got in mind?

538
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,560
I don't know, man.
But we need two more cars.

539
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,360
Yeah. Here they come.

540
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,560
Fonzie and Fabio.
Glad you can join us.

541
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,400
We heard you boys
wanted to get rid
of those CrackerJack toys.

542
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,280
No. Actually we just figured
those cars you got
deserved better drivers,

543
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,520
which is why we're gonna
take 'em off your hands.

544
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,760
- You know, why don't
we settle this now?
- Wait, wait.

545
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,000
How about we settle this
on the blacktop, huh?

546
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,400
Each car does it
down and back,
tag-team style...

547
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,440
for slips.
Loser walks home.

548
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,600
- We came to race.
- Well, load 'em up then.

549
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,640
Come on, bro.
Let's get these cars.

550
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,720
All right, check it out.
There's no way we gonna beat
these guys straight up.

551
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,080
The Hemi's puttin' out
about 425...

552
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,680
and that Yenko
will snap a speed on
about five seconds flat.

553
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,000
We're gonna have to pull
somethin' out of our ass.

554
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,960
The only thing I can think of
is save the spray for
the way back, the return trip.

555
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,320
Done deal.
All right.
Let's do this, bro.

556
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,320
I'm gettin'
that orange one.

557
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,800
You ain't ready, Fabio!

558
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,160
All right. You each
got a barrel to go around
down at the end of the road.

559
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,840
The second wave gotta
sit tight till your partner
crosses this line right here.

560
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,800
First team to go
down and back twice
wins the race.

561
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,840
At which point,

562
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,440
the losers will
hand over them keys.

563
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,440
Otherwise, you'll be eatin'
breakfast through straws
from now on.

564
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,920
Comprende?

565
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,840
I get it.

566
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,360
Oh, this means you too.

567
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,880
- I got it.
- right.

568
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,200
Let's race.

569
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,000
Come on, baby.!
You got this, Rome.
Let's do it.

570
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,320
Hey, you gone, homey.
I got this. This is done.

571
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,720
You about to lose
your car.

572
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,480
Do it, Rome!
Come on.
You got it.

573
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,200
You think I'm worried
about this fool, man?

574
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,160
This is nothin'.

575
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,800
- Aw, no.
- American muscle.

576
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,000
Your engine ain't
as big as your mouth.

577
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,920
Gotta smoke 'em. Gotta
smoke 'em. Gotta smoke 'em.

578
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,920
All right, here we go.
It's all right, baby.
I'm gonna handle this.

579
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,920
Handle it.

580
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,520
Ready and... go!

581
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,240
You ain't ready.
I run these streets.

582
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,000
Woo-hoo!

583
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,240
Romey Rome.
You ain't heard of me?

584
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,440
Oh, shit.

585
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,360
Oh, yeah!

586
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm-a get you.
Oh, I'm-a get you!

587
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,800
Where's your
big mouth now, boy?

588
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,600
That car's going home
with me, homey.

589
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,440
Oh, shit.
Eat this, sucker!

590
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,400
Shit!

591
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,720
Yeah, boy!
Go, Korpi!

592
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,840
Sorry, blondie.
How does that dust taste?

593
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,280
I don't know.

594
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,720
Come on, Rome.

595
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,320
What the...
Good move, kid. Let's see
if you got the balls. Come on!

596
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,120
- Whoo!

597
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,280
Goddamn! Come on!

598
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,600
Come on, Brian.
Bring it home, man.

599
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,280
Got two new cars!
That's all my man!

600
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,080
- Damn!

601
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,400
Y'all ain't ready, homeboy.
Get to walkin', Fabio.

602
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,120
Use them bus tokens, partner.!

603
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,320
Hey, how you doin'?

604
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,640
Good. What you need?
We're guests
of Mr. Verone's.

605
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,280
- It's a "hoasis"
in here, brah.
- Yeah.

606
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:40,560
Lots of potential.
Damn. You got a pen?

607
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,760
Phew. It's about to
get serious, brah.

608
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,080
Look at that girl
on the swing right there.

609
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,080
Hey. You guys
did something right.

610
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,360
- Verone never socializes
with hired help.
- Then what's that make you?

611
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,920
- Where's he at?
- He's on his way.

612
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,440
- You and Verone don't go
everywhere together?
- What's that supposed to mean?

613
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,680
Nothin'.

614
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,080
Huh. I'm-a go
take a piss.

615
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,040
You go do that.

616
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,240
What is his deal?
He doesn't trust people
that carry badges.

617
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,920
So you talk
like you know.

618
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,920
Yeah.
I'd been a cop
about two months...

619
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,200
when Roman was busted
in a garage raid.

620
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,640
He had eight sets of wheels
in his possession, each
and every one of them hot.

621
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,680
So you busted him?
No. I didn't even know
what was goin' down.

622
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,560
But, uh, that doesn't
really matter to him.

623
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,000
Basically, once
I became a cop,

624
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,360
Roman started
seeing me as a friend
that became the enemy.

625
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,440
You have a little...

626
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,240
Is there anything
I can get for you,
Mr. Verone?

627
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,280
Just tell 'em
to comejoin me.

628
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,200
Oh, yeah.
I was admiring this.

629
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,960
Yeah, I was looking
at it earlier.

630
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,040
- Damn.
- I wasn't about
to give it to you.

631
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,080
What's up?
He's here, man.

632
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,120
Where's he at?
He's over there.
Don't look.

633
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,720
Excuse me.
Mr. Verone would like
for you to join him.

634
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,680
Let's do it.

635
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,680
See what I'm talkin' about?

636
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,040
It's all right.
Let 'em in.

637
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,520
Go sit down.
I'll talk to you
in a second.

638
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,640
How ya doin'?
Good. You enjoying
your night?

639
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,640
Yeah. I'm havin'
a good time.
Good, good.

640
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:50,280
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

641
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,000
Hmm?
Yeah.

642
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,960
She's gorgeous.

643
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,600
You got balls, kid.

644
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,040
I can appreciate that.

645
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,720
Women are a very
powerful force.

646
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,800
You see the blond
sitting with
the gentleman right here?

647
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,800
Five minutes of her time,
and she can get anything
she wants from him.

648
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,200
- I love your hair.
- Watch.

649
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,840
I wonder where
they're going.
Sit down.

650
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,720
So, you, uh, lit my man's
car on fire. Is that right?

651
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,400
Yeah. I did.

652
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,560
You see, I got a problem
with authority.

653
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,840
Hmm. I have
that same problem.

654
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,880
For me, it's cops
in particular.

655
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,080
Let's take a walk.
Come on.
We just got here.

656
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,040
Now we're leaving.

657
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,000
Let's go.

658
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,320
Hey. Come on.

659
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,640
What's all that?

660
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,680
We're gonna have
a little fun.

661
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,200
- Hmm.
Thank you.

662
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,920
Let's just stay
a little longer.

663
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,920
- Hey, Carter.

664
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,360
Meet, uh,
Detective Whitworth.

665
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,880
One of Miami's finest.
Thank you, sweetheart.

666
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,720
Are you enjoying
yourself, Detective?
Yeah. I was.

667
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,320
I mean, you know me.

668
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,200
Yeah, I do know you.

669
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,480
- You been on my payroll
a long time.
- Verone, that ain't right.

670
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,360
Shut up.

671
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,400
I got one last job
for you, Detective.
You hear me?

672
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,400
Look, we've been
all through this.
Yeah?

673
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,320
Yeah. I said
I can't do it.

674
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,040
Hmm. That's
the wrong answer.
The table.

675
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,280
I'm a detective, Verone!
You do anything to me,

676
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,480
the whole force is gonna
be on your ass
in a minute.

677
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,880
Shut your mouth!
You fat piece of shit.

678
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,720
You can stop right now.

679
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,800
- What the hell...
What the hell is that?
- Sit down.

680
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,280
You're gonna regret this.
Just stop right now!

681
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,400
Once the bucket
gets hot enough,
Detective,

682
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,680
the rat is gonna
want out.

683
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,440
Get...

684
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,280
And the only direction
it can go is south.

685
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,320
Hey! Get...
Hey!

686
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,120
Hold that.

687
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:40,200
- Get it off me!
I'll forget it ever happened.
- Shut up.

688
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,560
Did you know that
your average rat...

689
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,520
Can chew through
a steel drain pipe?

690
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,840
You see, you have nothing
to worry about when he's
screaming, Detective.

691
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,840
It's when he goes quiet
that he goes to work.

692
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,560
Stop it.! Stop it.!
Stop it.!

693
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,840
Don't be stupid.
Stop it now.

694
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:02,600
You're in charge of the units
that are watching
my properties, huh?

695
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,920
What I want is,
I want a 15-minute window...

696
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,320
where everybody...
and I mean everybody...
disappears.

697
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,120
You hear me?
I can't do it!

698
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,960
- Stop it.
I can't do it. Help.!
- Okay. Monica, come here.

699
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,280
- Help.! Help.!
- Shut him up.
Shut him up.

700
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:22,240
Help! Help!

701
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,120
Help.!

702
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,840
Help! Help!

703
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,480
He's biting me!

704
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,960
- Help.! Help.!
- What?

705
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,160
- You got somethin'
you wanna say?

706
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,680
He bit me!

707
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,920
- Yes, I'll do it.!
- Do what? Say it.

708
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,080
I'll do it.
I'll give you your window.

709
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:48,680
Just get it off me!

710
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,040
Get it off!

711
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,440
You betray me,

712
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,040
and my rat here...

713
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,240
is gonna visit
your wife, Lynn... yeah...

714
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,600
your son, Clay,
and your daughter, Lexi.

715
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,320
Do you hear me?
You understand me? Huh?

716
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,080
You hear me?
Yes.

717
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,400
I'll burn your... eyes out!
I'll burn 'em out!

718
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,360
Get it off me.

719
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,280
Good. Now you can go.
Get it off me.

720
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,480
Get rid ofhim.
Let's go.
Get if off!

721
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,880
Mm. You boys
enjoy the show?

722
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,560
Fifteen minutes, and then
every cop in Florida
is gonna be on you.

723
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,320
Be at Versailles Cafe,
6:00 a.m., day after tomorrow,
ready to drive.

724
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,440
- You understand?
- Yeah.

725
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,360
Don't play games with me,
or you'll be next. All right?

726
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,600
Help yourself
to a little champagne.
Let's go.

727
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,360
That was
a damn rat, man.

728
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,320
Hey.

729
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,400
You ever... touch
another man again,
and I'll kill you.

730
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,560
You hear me?
Look at me.

731
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,520
You hear me?

732
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,960
She was into it, man.
What's that about?

733
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,440
And you seen the way
she grabbed
the dude's head.

734
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,160
She had to, man.
He was testing her.
You gotta remember,

735
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,720
her ass is on the line,
just like ours.

736
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,720
You feelin' this girl
way too much.

737
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,400
She just like that
crazy-ass trailer-raff
from back-in-the-day, Tonya.

738
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,640
Tonya? Man, you
went out with her
after I did.

739
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,760
I mean, I couldn't
let her go to waste.

740
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,800
I got you, I got you,
I got you.

741
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,720
Is that right?
See, we can race
for cash,

742
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,720
but when I step on the gas,
my nitrous go blast,
leave your ass in the past.

743
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,240
And, Tej, you about
to lose your garage.
Whatever, man.

744
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,280
I'm a low-budget mechanic,
but I overcharge.

745
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,200
Pay me!
Let's go, man!

746
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,200
Pay me my money.
I told you, man.

747
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,200
You a happy man.
I'm so glad.

748
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,280
This is my garage, boy.
Royal flush!

749
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,320
Give me this, man.
Holler, huh! Yes!

750
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,840
Did I talk to him?
Talk to him.
Damn.

751
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,480
You can't play a player. Put
that money back on the table.
You know it's my next hand.

752
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,200
Jimmy, how you
gonna pay me back
if you keep losing to Tej?

753
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,240
How ya doin', bro?
I'm gonna crash, Tej.

754
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,240
I'll catch you tomorrow.
right, boy.

755
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,640
- What are you doin' here?
- Brian, they're gonna
kill you.

756
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,040
I heard him telling
Enrique and Roberto.

757
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,720
Once you finish the run, they're
putting a bullet in your head.

758
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,200
- You sure
you heard 'em right?
- I'm sure. I'm sure.

759
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,200
- Verone's boys is outs...

760
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,120
Oh, I see what
they lookin'for...
your little girlfriend here.

761
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,440
- They don't know I'm here.
I snuck out.
- What are they doin' here then?

762
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,520
I don't know.
Maybe they're guessing.
Hey, go stall them.

763
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,800
- Go stall them
for two minutes.
- Check her, homey. Check her.

764
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,400
Find what you was
lookin' for?

765
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,000
Hey, buddy. Hi, guys.
How ya doin'?

766
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,240
Oh, man, y'all still mad
about y'all car?

767
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,240
Don't even trip, homey.
Come on, man.
You can't take a joke?

768
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,800
Brian, this isn't about
being a good cop anymore
or-or doing your job.

769
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:41,840
They're gonna kill you.
You guys gotta pull out.

770
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,960
Verone pay y'all to keep
a straight face like that?

771
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,840
'Cause if I was makin'money,
shit, I'd get that mole
removed off my damn nose.

772
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,160
Okay? Okay.
Yeah.

773
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,160
How much
he pay y'all anyway?

774
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,600
Every time I see y'all, man,
y'all got the silk shirts on,

775
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,320
jewelry, you know,
lookin'real Miami.

776
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,640
You know? I caught you
walkin' up in the club,

777
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,840
you got the hamburger meat
all hangin' out, you know?

778
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,720
Don't make that run, Brian.
Don't make that run.

779
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,680
Be careful.

780
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,320
- Donde esta?
- Quien?

781
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,160
- You ain't comin' on my...

782
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,280
Hey, hey! Where you goin'?
You stay right here
with us, buddy.

783
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,080
Don't even think
about it.

784
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,120
Vamonos.!
Stay your ass off
my homeboy's boat.

785
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,080
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down now!

786
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,160
You first, asshole!
You first!

787
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,480
I'll shoot the shit
outta him!
Put the gun down!

788
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,080
- Tu primero.!

789
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,080
- Put down the gun now!

790
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,680
- Put down the gun!

791
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,680
Enough.

792
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,640
- Enough. Shut up.

793
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,800
Shut up.
It's over. Come on.

794
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,600
It's over. Let's go.

795
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,240
Let's have the gun. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

796
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,640
I'm glad to see you boys
are getting along so well.

797
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,640
Because tomorrow,
Roberto and Enrique...

798
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,600
are gonna be
riding along with you...

799
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,640
just so that we don't
have any problems.

800
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,640
I'll see you guys
in a bit.

801
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,800
What the hell was she
doin' in there, man?

802
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,280
Where'd you go
this morning?

803
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,240
I went to breakfast
with some friends.

804
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,040
- With friends.

805
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,040
I do have friends, Carter.

806
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,520
Okay.
I'll see you later.

807
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,880
- Nice shirt, Bilkins.
- It's my day off.

808
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,280
Yeah. Well, anyhow,
this is the deal.

809
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:44,320
Last night,
Verone threatened a cop
into giving us a window.

810
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:48,120
We're driving to an airstrip,
in the Keys,
off of Nallwood Avenue.

811
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,560
Verone has a plane there,
and he's taking off
for good.

812
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,360
- Wait a minute.
How do you know this?
- Monica.

813
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,880
She's doin' her job.
She warned us.

814
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:00,520
- She warned you about what?
- Verone plans to kill us
after we give him the money.

815
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,280
Driving into an ambush
was never part of the deal.

816
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,760
I'm calling this off.
Like hell you are. This
is a Customs case, Bilkins.

817
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,600
No one's calling this off
unless I do.

818
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,880
Look. This is real simple.

819
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,880
You make the run.
You get Verone
and his cash together...

820
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,800
so I can move in
for the bust.

821
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,080
All right? You don't, I will
find enough charges on both
of you to make you disappear.

822
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,960
Take these. We're gonna
have G.P.S. On you
the whole time...

823
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,920
to make sure you don't
get any cute ideas.

824
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,240
- And to make sure nothing
happens to them, right?
- Yeah, right.

825
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,760
The guy's a dick, man.
Yep.

826
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,920
Let me get this right.

827
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,880
If we don't do this,
then we go to jail.

828
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,800
But if we do it, then
Verone's gonna kill us.

829
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,960
It's a hell of a deal,
huh?

830
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,240
Yeah. Maybe it is.

831
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,040
But I know this guy's
got an ass full of loot...

832
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,680
that he's ready
to dump in our cars.

833
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,520
And I can think of two reasons
why Verone doesn't need
that money anymore.

834
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,160
- Ah, here we go.
- You and me.

835
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:10,280
Just like the old days.
What do you think?

836
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,680
I think they messed with
the wrong two guys.
That's what I think.

837
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,600
Yo, Tej.
What's up, bro?
What up?

838
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,680
Hey, man, how quickly
can you organize?

839
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,840
Look, folk,
if y'all really wanna
carry out this plan,

840
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,280
it's definitely
the best place to do it.

841
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,680
What do y'all think, man?
I think it's perfect.
What do they store here?

842
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,920
*Pump, p-p-pump, pump
P-P-P-Pump *

843
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,280
*Pump, p-p-pump
Pump it up *

844
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,040
*Pump, p-p-pump
Pump, p-pump, p-pump *
Hey, man, this thing's clean.

845
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,040
*Pump it up
Just blaze *
Strip it down.

846
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,800
*Pump, p-p-pump, pump it up *
* We gonna do it like
uh, uh, uh *

847
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,520
*Look, pump it up if you came
to get it krunk with a dame
and shit that's drunk *

848
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,920
* You came to get it on
More than five O's
in your bank *

849
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,320
* Then get it on
Roll up like that stank
and get it on *

850
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,320
*Slank that fitted on
Came to get it on *
Hey, Jimmy.

851
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,560
Yeah. What up?
We have any half-empty bottles
of nitrous laying around?

852
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,080
Sure, but I already
loaded you for spray.

853
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:00,320
No. I'm thinkin'
we may need it
for somethin' else,

854
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:03,560
'cause our cars may get
a little crowded,
you know?

855
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,600
*Pump, p-p-pump
Pump it up **

856
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,080
Man, when you start
eatin' so much?

857
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,960
I was in jail, brah.

858
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,240
I know how shitty
the grub is
on the inside.

859
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,640
With the way things is shapin'
up out here right now,

860
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,240
it'll be a matter of time
before I'm back in there
or dead.

861
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,360
So I'm tryin' to eat
all I can while I can.

862
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,360
Plus the doctor tell me
I got a high metabolism.

863
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,560
Man, you remember us
growing up?

864
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,440
You know, playing
football in the dirt.

865
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,800
You know, gettin' in trouble,
all the stupid things we did.

866
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,920
When you got busted, you know,
whether I was a cop or not,

867
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,880
you know, if there was
anything I could've done,

868
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,560
I would've done it,
and I just want you
to know that.

869
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,040
Is that why you let
that dude go in L.A.?

870
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,200
Yeah. I think that had
a lot to do with it.

871
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,840
When I got busted,
it wasn't your fault.

872
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,360
It was all on me,
Mr. Roman Pearce...

873
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,680
wild-and-out crazy, man.

874
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,360
No one can tell me
nothin;

875
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,120
- Ridin' solo.
- Yeah, well, not anymore.

876
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,520
Not anymore, bro.

877
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:01,040
I got Verone's Navigator
leavin' the residence.

878
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,800
Copy. Sir, we've got
Verone on the move
to the airstrip.

879
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,920
Good. Let's get a bird
in the air. Tell him
to keep his distance.

880
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,160
Good and tight.
Ready to go.
Channel two. Channel two.

881
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,880
You're all set.
Thanks.

882
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,480
All set?
Yep. Let's do it.

883
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,160
Report.

884
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,480
What's goin'on out there?

885
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,560
- Team one checking in.
- Team two checking in.

886
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,400
- Team three checking in.
- Team four.
All clear here too.

887
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,400
Team five checkin' in.

888
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:40,000
This is team six.
All clear.

889
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,040
Here we go.
Yeah, so you know what to do.

890
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,800
Just stay cool,
keep focused.

891
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,040
Remember, the airstrip's
on Nallwood Avenue.

892
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,040
It's the third exit
after the bridge.

893
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,520
- Got it.
- So what up, man?
You ready for this?

894
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,720
Come on, man.
Guns, murderers
and crooked cops?

895
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,320
- I was made for this, brah.

896
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,160
Come on.

897
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,760
I got activity at Verone's
trailer property.

898
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,800
Do not move an inch
until I tell you to.

899
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,960
Load up.

900
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:40,720
All units, move on
the trailer property
right now. Move!

901
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,040
Shit! Local P.D.
Is moving in
on our guys.

902
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,720
Three bags in one car, huh?
Guess so.

903
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,200
Cops.

904
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:14,720
- I'm not goin' back to jail.
- Where you goin', man?
Let's go! Let's go!

905
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,680
What is he doin'?

906
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,160
Okay, now let's get
the chopper over them.
I want eyes right on top.

907
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,840
You got it.
Lima 25, follow G.P.S.

908
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,280
You know what
you're doin', man?

909
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,120
Stay with me, Rome.
Stay with me.
Come on, man.

910
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,080
I've got 'em
heading south on l-95.

911
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,920
Bring in the aerial E.S.D.'s.

912
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,680
Oh, shit!

913
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,240
- They're catching up, man!
- Shut up, man!

914
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,880
- Yeah, nice drivin', Rome.
Nice drivin'.
- I gotcha, Brian.

915
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,200
Check it out, man!

916
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,480
What was that?

917
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,000
Oh, shit.

918
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,960
- Come on, man.
Take the wheel.
- No. I can't drive.

919
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,080
Just hold the wheel!
I can't drive!

920
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,480
Hold it right there!
Just hold it steady,
just like that.

921
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,040
What are you doin', man?

922
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:46,680
Que pasa?

923
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,000
Whoo!
Yeah, man!

924
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,880
Hold.

925
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,840
Bilkins,
the bird's in place.

926
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:02,520
Yeah. We got
Verone's Navigator.

927
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,520
All right.
Money's in transit.
Sit tight.

928
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,680
You're a good driver, man.

929
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,440
Thanks, bro.

930
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,960
We've got the area
blocked ahead.
They've got nowhere to go.

931
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,720
Oh! What was that?

932
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,920
I've got a visual.
Video should be
coming through.

933
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,280
We got it.
Looks good.

934
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,560
Where are they going?

935
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,800
Oh, shit!

936
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,560
All right, Miami's finest,
let's see what you got.

937
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,360
Come on.
Stay with me, boys.

938
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,200
- Hey, man. Everyone's here.
Time for the show.
- Let's give it to 'em.

939
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,880
All right. Let the party
begin. Let's go.

940
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,880
This is unit 2599.
We have the suspects
surrounded.

941
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:10,200
Holy shit!

942
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:19,160
It's a scramble, baby.
A big one!

943
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,040
Yeah! Let's do this!

944
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,720
- Check this out!

945
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,600
We're not tracking them
on video.

946
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,440
Must have lost them
in the scramble.

947
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,360
Y'all, let's break.

948
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,120
Yeah!

949
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,800
All right. We got 'em
going west on Beach.

950
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,320
Roger that.
I've got 'em.

951
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:51,800
Customs has a fix
on two cars going
west on Beach.

952
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,000
Roger. Follow those cars.
Roger that.

953
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:19,760
Shit.
They're cornered.

954
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:27,080
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.!

955
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,440
- Put your hands up.!
- Whoa. Fellas, fellas.

956
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,840
I know my tags are
out of date, but, damn!

957
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:44,040
What the hell?
Where are they?

958
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,400
Man.! How about them apples,
man?

959
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:11,720
Yeah! That's some drivin' for
your ass, baby! Ain't that
some drivin' for your ass?

960
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,840
- Good job, man.
- Whatever, man.

961
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,800
You supposed to be
a stone-face killer.

962
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,800
You over there
grabbin' your seat belt.

963
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,640
Hey, Tej. Thanks a lot.
You're the clutch.
I owe you one, big time.

964
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,760
Yeah, Brian, you really
do owe me, man.

965
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,920
You really do... Us.
Suki says you owe us,
right?

966
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,760
- Yo, Rome. You there, man?
Come in.
- What's up, man?

967
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:36,880
It looks like we got just
one more trick left, huh?

968
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,840
My pleasure, buddy.
Let's do it, baby.

969
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:44,360
Hey. We should grab Verone
while we still can.
No. Not yet.

970
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,120
What? You lost 'em?

971
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,400
Shit! Those little pricks
are running.

972
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,720
- It's your call.
What do you want to do?
- We're gonna take him down.

973
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,680
He is not leaving here.

974
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:00,360
Enjoyin' the ride?
Man, it's a fast car, huh?

975
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,120
Man, it's a classic.

976
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,600
Old school.
American muscle.

977
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,280
Man, this car can do
all kinda things, man.

978
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,640
Wanna see?

979
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:15,560
Check this out
right here, homey.

980
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,400
Yo! What are you
doin', man?
Shut up!

981
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,880
- "Ejecto seato," cuz!

982
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,960
It worked.!
I love this button.!

983
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:36,360
- Stay on your toes, puto!

984
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,040
Mr. O'Conner,
it worked, baby.

985
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:40,000
Blow and go.
I'm all clear.

986
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,640
- Meet me at the point.
Hurry up, man. It's on, baby.
- All right. Ten-four, man.

987
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,240
Are you ready?
Let's go!

988
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,520
I got this side.!

989
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,800
Raise your hands!
Raise your hands!
Raise your hands!

990
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:59,800
Get down! Get down!
Get down!

991
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,360
Clear.!
We're clear.!

992
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,240
Back it up.!

993
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,200
It's not Verone and Fuentes.
What do you mean?

994
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:12,160
Then where the hell
are they?

995
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,880
Get off at Tarpon Point.

996
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,280
Tarpon Point? There's...
There's no airstrip
at Tarpon Point.

997
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:28,680
Who said anything
about an airstrip?

998
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,720
Brian. Brian, man,
what's the holdup, brah?

999
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,280
- Yo, Rome,
there's a new plan.
- What the hell?

1000
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,720
We're meeting them at
the Tarpon Point exit,
not the airstrip.

1001
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,160
- So what are you sayin'?
- Like I said,
there's a new plan.

1002
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:59,240
Brian. Brian, hello?
You there?

1003
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,360
Damn!
Yo! What the hell
is he doin'?

1004
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,840
The feds are in the wrong place.
Brian's woman is on her own
with Verone.

1005
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,400
- So...
- So Brian's not comin'.

1006
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:28,520
- It's all right.
Let him out.
- Get out.

1007
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,240
Pop the trunk.

1008
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,560
Hurry up.

1009
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,920
- Where's the rest of it?
- The other car.

1010
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,200
- Another car.
Where's the other car?
- On it's way.

1011
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,200
- On the way, huh?
- Yeah. Here's your money.

1012
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,520
So you know nothing
about the agents
that stormed my jet?

1013
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:17,960
The funny thing is that
I only told one person
about the airstrip.

1014
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,040
Hmm.

1015
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:36,520
Customs agents sure
are gettin' pretty,
aren't they?

1016
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,960
Put her on the boat.

1017
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,360
- Let's go.
- Get on the boat.

1018
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,680
- Hide the cars
and get rid of him.
- Back in the car.

1019
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,640
End of the road.

1020
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:37,040
You know, I like you,
but I still gotta kill you.

1021
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:39,400
It's my job.

1022
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:43,560
- What's that?

1023
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,320
- What's that?
- It's Barstow, baby!
It's about to get ugly!

1024
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,720
Let's go.
Let's go.

1025
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,280
Get your...
Oh, shit!

1026
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,120
Come on.

1027
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,200
You had me.

1028
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,560
You slipped.

1029
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,680
Eleven and a half months,
and you slipped once.

1030
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,680
Put her downstairs.

1031
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,600
I'll see you
in a second.

1032
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,640
I thought you was dead, man.
Yeah. Me too. Thanks
for saving my ass, bro.

1033
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:28,240
What are you doin', Brian?
I don't know,

1034
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,520
but if Verone sees a helicopter
or Customs boat, she's dead.

1035
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,360
Boat. Car.

1036
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,320
Boat... You're not gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

1037
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,440
- Yeah, I think so.
You got my back, bro?
- Yeah.

1038
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,360
- Put on a seat belt.
- Show 'em some real
Dukes of Hazzard shit.

1039
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,200
We're gonna do this big.
Hold on, Rome. Hold on.

1040
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:55,240
Oh.! Brian, you crazy, man.!
What the hell you doin'?

1041
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,720
- Brian, what the hell
you doin'?

1042
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,560
Whoa!

1043
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:06,040
Shit!

1044
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:20,720
My arm. I think
I broke my arm, man.

1045
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,800
Get the gun.

1046
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,600
It's over, Carter.

1047
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,520
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1048
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,000
I'm great.

1049
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:17,600
We got 'em, man.
We got 'em.

1050
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,600
Let's get outta here.

1051
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,120
Go! Go!

1052
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,760
That ought to do it.

1053
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,880
So, there were
three bags total, huh?
The three from the boat.

1054
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,520
So we good, right?
My record's clean?

1055
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:01,320
You held up your end.
Your records are clean.

1056
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,880
So maybe
there was six bags.

1057
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:25,120
I guess we can
call it even.

1058
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,200
Agent Dunn.
Sir.

1059
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,480
We found some
more evidence.

1060
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,240
Come on.
Let's take it
to the truck.

1061
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:42,920
Don't drop the soap,
big homey.

1062
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,000
I hope you know
that when he gets out,
he's gonna kill your ass.

1063
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:50,920
He ain't gettin' out.

1064
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,880
- I'll see you soon.
- You think
he gonna get out?

1065
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,280
He'll be out.

1066
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,240
No, for real. You think
he gettin' out, though?

1067
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,680
We took care
of your decoys.
They're free and clear.

1068
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,800
There's a sedan
out on the road
for you.

1069
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:10,040
Try to bring it back
in one piece.
Yeah.

1070
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:13,320
- Thanks a lot, Bilkins.
You're all right.
- Thanks.

1071
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:16,040
- Thanks for lookin' out, man.

1072
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:21,240
- So you trust me now?
- You right.

1073
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,960
Sorry.

Oh, man,

1080
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,800
Miami's

1081
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:02,720
Open a garage together.
A garage?
