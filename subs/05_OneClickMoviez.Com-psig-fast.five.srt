00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,360
The feds have got
to show everyone
their agents are off limits

168
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
and they're going to send
their best guys. We got
to get out of here.

169
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,320
One thing we know for sure

170
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,280
is that they wanted this car.

171
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,080
Because something is in it.

172
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,680
If we find out what it is,
we'll know what we're
up against.

173
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,000
HOBBS: All right, listen up!
The men we're after
are professional runners.

174
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,800
They like speed and are
guaranteed to go down
the hardest possible way

175
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,200
so make sure you got
your funderwear on.

176
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,040
We find them, we take them
as a team, and we bring
them back.

177
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,440
And above all else,
we don't ever, ever let
them get into cars.

178
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,000
Crime scene is 10 hours old
and counting, men.
Let's go hunting.

179
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,000
Agente Hobbs!
Chief of Police,
João Alemeida.

180
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,200
Luke.

181
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,360
Sorry to hear about
the loss of your men.

182
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,400
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

183
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,960
Let me tell you something
about these two men.

184
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,440
One is a former federal
officer, been in deep cover
for five years.

185
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,280
He knows every way
you're going to come
for him.

186
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,320
The other one is
a professional criminal,
escaped prison twice,

187
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,840
spent half his life
on the run avoiding
folks like you.

188
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,640
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...

189
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,680
Two things.
One, I need a translator.

190
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,200
We have plenty
in the public relations
department.

191
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,000
Elena Neves.

192
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,840
A patrol officer?
You heard me.

193
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,680
But why?
We have many
more experienced people.

194
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,680
I like her smile.

195
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,600
What's the second thing?

196
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,400
Stay the fuck out of my way.

197
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,680
(DRILLING)

198
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,800
Brian.
Hm?

199
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,560
I have something
I have to tell you.

200
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,240
(DOOR OPENING)
VINCE: God damn.

201
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,040
What a mess!

202
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,360
Where you been, man?

203
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,920
(CHUCKLING)

204
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,800
You better check that tone.

205
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,640
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.

206
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,160
Stop it!
Both of you.

207
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
Where were you, Vince?

208
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,480
Guys all over
the favelas asking
about you.

209
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,080
Couldn't get out of there
without leading them
straight to you.

210
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,200
Had to wait them out.

211
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,920
That is such horseshit.

212
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,000
(SHOUTING) That was your job,
and those were your guys!
Hey!

213
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,600
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

214
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,400
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it.

215
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,520
Go walk it off.

216
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,480
REYES: Look, I would love
to expand my operations
into your countries

217
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,400
but, quite frankly,
your business methods
are too violent.

218
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,600
Let me tell you a true story.

219
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,920
Five hundred years ago,
the Portuguese
and the Spanish came here,

220
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,320
each trying to get the country
from their natives.

221
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,760
The Spaniards arrived,
guns blazing, determined
to prove who was boss.

222
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,160
The natives killed
every single Spaniard.

223
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,760
Personally, I prefer
the methods of the Portuguese.

224
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,880
They came bearing gifts.

225
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,160
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

226
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,520
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,

227
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,720
but to continue receiving
them, they had to work
for the Portuguese.

228
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,080
And that's why
all Brazilians speak
Portuguese today.

229
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,440
Now, if you dominate
the people with violence,

230
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,600
they will eventually
fight back because
they have nothing to lose.

231
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
And that's the key.

232
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,920
I go into the favelas
and give them
something to lose.

233
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,640
Electricity, running water,

234
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,760
school rooms for their kids.

235
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,040
And for that taste
of a better life,

236
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,400
I own them.

237
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Gentlemen.

238
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,360
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

239
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,920
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

240
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,120
I apologize for
the interruption.

241
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,080
Señor Reyes,
may I speak with you?

242
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,560
We've found them.

243
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,080
Pardon me, gentlemen.

244
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,520
DOM: Almost wish
I didn't see that.

245
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,560
Almost.

246
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,600
Wait, Dom.

247
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,760
Mia was on that train.

248
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,400
(SHOUTING)
My sister!

249
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,520
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do
anything to hurt her.

250
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,840
You set up the deal!

251
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,440
I thought the job
was for the cars.

252
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,560
I didn't know.

253
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,040
All they want is the chip.

254
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,600
Damn!

255
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,800
You should've come clean.

256
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,400
What's going on out here?

257
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,400
Nothing.

258
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,800
Please, Dom, just let
me have the chip.
I can take this to them.

259
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,960
They'll give it to Reyes
and set things right.

260
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,960
Get out.

261
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,640
What?

262
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Get out!

263
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,480
You never listen to me.

264
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,080
Not when I told you
he was a cop, and not now.

265
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,680
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.

266
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,960
Look at our family now.

267
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,880
I can't go home!
Your sister is stuck
in this life!

268
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,840
Where's Letty, Dom?

269
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,200
Where's Letty?

270
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,080
Plasma cutter.

271
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,280
Wilkes, I want a list
of every place within 50 miles

272
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,040
that distributes
compressed gas tanks.

273
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,160
Pass me that manifest.

274
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,480
Officer Neves.
Been waiting for you.

275
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,840
You asked for me?
I did.

276
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,520
May I ask why?

277
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,920
My smile
is not that great.

278
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,800
Your husband was
an officer who was
gunned down in the favela.

279
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,680
Six months later,
you upped and joined
the force.

280
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,000
You're motivated.

281
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,680
Plus, I figure you're
the only one in Rio
who can't be bought.

282
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,120
Am I right?

283
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,400
Yes.
Of course I am.

284
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,600
Good news, bad news.

285
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,280
You know I like
my dessert first.

286
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,240
Back-checked
the rail line like you asked.

287
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,240
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.

288
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,960
One set of tracks
headed west

289
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,600
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.

290
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,920
But another set
of tracks headed east.

291
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,280
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

292
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,840
The GT40 that was missing
from the manifest.

293
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,440
Followed the trail
a couple of miles.

294
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,680
Pretty easy in this scrub.

295
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,440
Can't move without
leaving a sign.

296
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,920
Give me the damn veggies.

297
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,160
The ground rolls into
a hardpack and we lost
that track, too.

298
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,880
Not necessarily.

299
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,240
That road heads up
through the hills
into the favelas.

300
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,560
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.

301
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,920
It's all dirt a mile
from where you were.

302
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,040
If they headed that way,
we'll pick up
their tracks there.

303
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,280
You come prepared.

304
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,760
I'm motivated.

305
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
HOBBS: All right, then.

306
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,120
Let's find ourselves a car.

307
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,120
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

308
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
What do you think?

309
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,880
Well, it's definitely
a custom chip.

310
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.

311
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,280
Let's check this one.

312
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,160
Look at that.

313
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,560
Same building,
same order every week.

314
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,400
It's a delivery schedule.

315
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,640
What's this?

316
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,960
Drugs?

317
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,840
No. That's a dealer pack.

318
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,760
See, most major players,
they weigh their money

319
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,640
so they don't have
to constantly count it.

320
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,000
Right there,
that's 49 kilos.

321
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,960
49 kilos is a million
in twenties.

322
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,000
You're saying each one
of these shipments

My father.

405
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,120
He used to...

406
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,000
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.

For anybody
in the neighborhood.

408

If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.

409
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,480
Every single day he was
in the shop, and every
single night,

410
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,360
he was at the kitchen table
with Mia, helping her
with her homework.

411
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,240
Even after she went to sleep,

412
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,240
he'd stay up
for a few more hours

413
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:21,120
so he could learn
the next chapter
and help her the next day.

414
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,960

about my father.

415

I don't remember
him smiling.

420

I don't even remember
what the hell he looked like.

two precision drivers.

to come to Rio

for something more

you drag us halfway

so our target's name
is Hernan Reyes.

And he runs
the drug scene down here.

He's never been busted
because he doesn't
leave a paper trail.

No paper trail
means no banks.

I thought this was business.

521
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,440

but you just, kind of,
got to...

That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,

530

we split even.

01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,840
An honest man.

957
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,840
We both grew up here.

958
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,000
Two years ago he was
murdered in the street

959
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,760
right outside our door.

960
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,760
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.

961
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,200
But everything
has a price.

962
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,480
The people here
need a new start.

963
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,480
They need
to be free.

(SIGHS)

965
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,560
You didn't kill
those men in the train,

966
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,440
did you?

967
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,480
Now, why would you
believe anything
I would tell you?

968
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,320
Hey!

969
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,200
Was she so special to you?

970
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,040
I never thought anyone
could understand how much.

971
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,680
But you do.

972
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:27,880
Yeah!

973
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,880
Close, but not enough.

974
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,920
Dom, the window
is too small, man.

975
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,600
Only way we're going to
beat the cameras is
with invisible cars.

976
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,480
And I know just where
to get them.

977

Don't hurt yourself.

979
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,400
It's been a while since
I've been behind the wheel
of one of these.

980
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,520
First time I've ever
been in the front seat.

(CHUCKLES)

982

Rome, what took
you so long?

983
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:39,480
I thought for sure you'd be
showing up with some
chrome spinners or something.

984
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,480
Real funny.

985
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:46,400
I got $100,000 that says
I can take you all
in the next quarter-mile.

986
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,960
Yeah, your broke ass
has got a hundred grand.

987
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,280
If we pull off this job,
I will.

988
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,040
The next two lights.

989
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,440
Hundred thousand.

990
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:57,040
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

991
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,520
Let's make it a million.

992
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,600
I like that.
All right,
a million-dollar quarter-mile.

993
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,280
All right, then.

994
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:08,000
You only live once.
Let's do it.

995
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,480
What do you say, Dom?

996
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,520
We talking or we racing?

997
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,960
Just don't cheat this time.

998
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,080

Typical, Roman.

1002

I'm going to get
this money. I'm hungry.

1003
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,320
Don't make it too
easy for me, boys.

No!

Not this time, Dom.

You got to want it, Brian.

Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

Good race, O'Conner.
Thanks, Dom.

1009

Do you know how long
I've been waiting
for that shit?

1010
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,800
I told you
he didn't see it.

1011
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,640
Your man right there?

1012
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,040
He let off the throttle
at the line.

1013
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,720
You didn't do nothing.
He let you win.

1014
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,280
Bullshit.

You know me.
Money ain't a goddamn thing.
