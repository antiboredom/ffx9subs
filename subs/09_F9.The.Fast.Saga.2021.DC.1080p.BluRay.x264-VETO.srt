1
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:21,434
<i>That's the cleanup
crew up on the track,</i>

2
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,752
<i>and that's a lot of racers
involved there, folks.</i>

3
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:42,187
Jack, you realize you got
this in the bag, right?

4
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,499
Season's wrapped up, man.
Doesn't matter where you place.

5
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:45,750
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

6
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:46,900
- Last two laps.
- On it!

7
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:48,235
Get those plug wires!

8
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:49,903
Jakob! Now.

9
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:52,614
Hey, Pop.

10
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:53,865
Tell me what you see, Dom.

11
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,784
Got an oil spill
going into turn two.

12
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:56,868
Bell's driving safe.

13
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:58,972
Corbin's got a sponsor in the stands,
so he's pushing it.

14
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,289
Talking about me?

15
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:02,249
You got a real problem
with car 23.

16
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,334
- Linder.
- About to whip your ass, Toretto!

17
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,688
- Settle down, pretty boy!
- That's right. Yeah, you.

18
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,147
- Shut up!
- You want to tell your driver

19
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,649
- he's gonna get somebody hurt?
- What'd you say?

20
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,353
- Hey! Leave it!
- Go home! You suck!

21
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:12,485
He's just pissed
I got that spot

22
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,219
in the Busch Series
next season, not him.

23
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:16,763
Life's got no shortage of guys
like Kenny Linder.

24
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:18,015
You're good!

25
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:23,312
It's not about being
the stronger man, Dom.

26
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:24,980
It's about being
the bigger one.

27
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:56,219
I swear to God, this guy.

28
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:05,270
Pop, turn two, turn two!

29
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:11,985
Got it. I'm walking him in.

30
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:18,867
Shit!

31
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,669
Tell me what you see, Dom.

32
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,427
He's gonna
come at you for that.

33
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:45,811
Get ready on your left.

34
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:52,210
Three-eighths ratchet.

35
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:58,842
Three-eighths driver.

36
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:01,511
Six-inch extension.

37
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,434
Are you sure?

38
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:20,906
Remember what your
daddy told you.

39
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,741
Be precise in life.

40
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:26,036
It can make all the difference.
Now, watch this.

41
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:29,998
See how it's working now?

42
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,000
And you see
what's happening?

43
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:34,419
It's turning the screw.

44
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:36,004
You're right.

45
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,798
Water heater's out again.

46
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:41,468
It's the price we pay
for peace and quiet.

47
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:44,804
Want to come
and give us a hand?

48
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,602
Are you expecting someone?

49
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,815
Brian, remember
what we practiced.

50
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:22,551
Yo, yo!

51
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,180
We come in peace.
We come in peace!

52
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:30,684
It's me!

53
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:34,980
Roman? Maybe you
don't recognize me

54
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,023
'cause I've been tanning
all week, bro.

55
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:41,611
B, come out, son.

56
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:51,997
What you gonna do
with that thing, man?

57
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:54,362
What, you out here trying to
kill elephants or something?

58
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,709
We would've
called first.

59
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:59,087
Except you actually need phones
in order to get phone calls.

60
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,255
You know that, right?

61
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,923
- Little B!
- Hi.

62
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:03,425
Wow.
You're so big. Hi.

63
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,385
Now, I know you don't carpool.

64
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:08,847
So what's up?

65
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,974
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

66
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:13,602
<i>My plane is under attack
by a rogue agent!</i>

67
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:19,733
<i>We're being boarded.
I've got dangerous cargo on board.</i>

68
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:21,502
<i>I need you to assemble the team.</i>

69
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:23,087
<i>...still alive.
I'll explain...</i>

70
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,824
It's an SOS transmission
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

71
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,452
It came through with
a mess of encrypted data,

72
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,887
most of which
I'm still trying to crack.

73
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:33,973
- Did anybody else get this?
- Well, that's the thing.

74
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:35,624
He sent it only to us.

75
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,209
Why just us?

76
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:48,261
He caught Cipher.

77
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:51,640
But there was a midair attack,
and she was extracted.

78
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,809
It seems his plane crashed
somewhere here,

79
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,228
over the northwest region
of Montequinto.

80
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:59,814
If Mr. Nobody survived,
we need to find him.

81
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:01,524
But the whole area's
sealed off.

82
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,693
Isolationist, run by military.

83
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:05,028
We're not on call anymore.

84
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:13,328
Wait, wait.
Dom, this is Cipher.

85
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,831
The woman who killed
the mother of your child.

86
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,961
Things change.

87
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,637
Listen, we're wheels up
at 8:00 a.m.

88
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,389
if you change your mind.

89
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:34,224
Thank you.

90
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:39,562
Daddy,
do you know where God is?

91
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,940
- Where is God?
- In your heart.

92
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,484
He's in your heart, too.

93
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,236
And you know something?

94
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:48,822
I'll always be in your heart.

95
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:50,740
Hey, little guy.

96
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:52,659
I have a gift for you.

97
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:55,578
Your father
gave this to me.

98
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,748
And now I'm gonna
give it to you.

99
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:02,794
It's very special.

100
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:04,754
Take care of it.

101
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:22,647
Good night.

102
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,577
This isn't who we are.

103
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:42,333
Brian and Mia got out of the game
when they became parents.

104
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:45,378
We're not them.

105
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,453
<i>...under attack by a rogue agent!</i>

106
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:32,717
<i>We're being boarded.
I've got dangerous cargo on board.</i>

107
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:34,761
<i>...assemble the team.</i>

108
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:36,404
<i>...still alive.
I'll explain...</i>

109
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,115
<i>...still alive.
I'll explain...</i>

110
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,127
Mia, it's Dom.

111
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,257
I need a favor.

112
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,352
You know, I would love to see my nephew
just a little bit more often

113
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:26,354
than, say,
world-ending emergencies

114
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:30,233
- and holidays, once in a while, maybe.
- Okay.

115
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,863
And how's the buster?

116
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:38,324
He's good.
He's really good.

117
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:42,495
You know,
now that I'm a father,

118
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:49,002
I can't stop thinking
about our dad.

119
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:51,921
And, uh...

120
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,967
What life would have
been like if he was alive.

121
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:01,681
We'd be a very different people,
don't you think?

122
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,810
Dom, what's happened?

123
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,479
Something I hope
I'm wrong about.

124
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:49,145
Coming up on the signal,
two miles

125
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:52,065
It's deep in the militarized
zone of Montequinto.

126
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:54,067
- I hope everyone's ready.
- Ready?

127
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:57,528
Y'all want to make jokes
about me not making practical decisions?

128
00:12:57,904 --> 00:12:59,697
This is as prepared
as it gets.

129
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:01,532
We all see you, man.

130
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:04,452
Nobody thinks you're
compensating for anything.

131
00:13:13,628 --> 00:13:15,505
- I'll take point.
- Careful.

132
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:17,882
Careful's when you get hurt.

133
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:35,108
Right now, we have a ten-minute
window between patrols.

134
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,653
Mr. Nobody's signal is close,
but we've got to move quickly, guys.

135
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,030
We do not want to cross paths
with the military here.

136
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:08,683
- It's inside.
- Cover us.

137
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,872
The source of the SOS signal is coming
from inside this thing.

138
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,127
Somebody wanted in.

139
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:39,589
Plane must have gone down before
they could cut through.

140
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:42,091
Or it was sent down on purpose
to stop 'em.

141
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,552
Yeah, well, their mistake
was trying to cut into it.

142
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,596
But just give me a minute.
I can get in.

143
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:50,975
Dom.

144
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:52,477
There's not
a soul in sight.

145
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,604
No sign of Mr. Nobody.

146
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,397
Got it.

147
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,864
What the hell is this?

148
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:07,950
Whatever it is,
Mr. Nobody wanted us to find it.

149
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:10,161
How's that work...

150
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,579
Go!

151
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,619
What? You don't know who I am?

152
00:15:52,245 --> 00:15:53,663
You think I'm scared?

153
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:20,791
Roman, where the hell
are you?

154
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,259
Who's compensating now, Tej?

155
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,410
<i>"Peligro minas."</i>
What does that mean?

156
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:57,930
Tej, how fast we got
to go to clear 'em?

157
00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:59,348
Please don't tell me
you're thinking

158
00:17:59,372 --> 00:18:00,724
- what I think you're thinking.
<i>- Why?</i>

159
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,708
What does
<i>"peligro minas"</i> mean?

160
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,627
- Tej, how fast?
- I don't know, man.

161
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,750
<i>Somebody answer me!</i>

162
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,380
What does
<i>"peligro minas"</i> mean?

163
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:08,547
<i>"Peligro minas"</i> means

164
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:09,757
"danger, land mines"!

165
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,841
What?

166
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:14,845
How fast, Tej?

167
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:16,973
Assuming
a 50-foot blast radius

168
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,850
and a half a second trigger
delay, I'd say about 80.

169
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:20,977
I can't!

170
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:24,188
My speedometer only goes up to 70.
What do I do?

171
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,648
You put your foot
to that floor,

172
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,816
and you pray!

173
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:15,948
Get to that palm plantation,
and then we're clear.

174
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,281
Whoa!

175
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:09,752
Whoa!

176
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:14,590
Roman, you good?

177
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,554
My ass is <i>en fuego!</i>

178
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:32,066
Tej! Wait! Land mine!

179
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,310
How in the hell
are you not dead?

180
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,645
I'm fine.

181
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,281
Wait, okay, I think
I found us another way out.

182
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,326
Two miles to what looks like
a bridge across the border.

183
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,912
Good. The sooner we get out of here,
the better.

184
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:12,750
Letty, on the right.

185
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:52,414
The device.

186
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:14,728
Get in.

187
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,167
That was Jakob back there,
wasn't it?

188
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:10,492
- Always check your mirrors, bitches!
- Oh, my God.

189
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,578
Oh, hell no.

190
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:14,246
Are we supposed
to drive across that?

191
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,373
Well, I said
it looked like a bridge.

192
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:31,972
Oh, my God!

193
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,535
The military's not giving up.

194
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,079
We got to get
past the border.

195
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:53,846
Where's the bridge?

196
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,893
No. No, no.

197
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:01,019
Dom.

198
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,639
Well, that was new.

199
00:26:57,493 --> 00:26:59,119
Look, we're in the clear.

200
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,331
But this thing is a mess.

201
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,750
The headlines out there?

202
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,961
Secret spy plane
crashes in a hostile country?

203
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,714
Followed by some kind
of covert ops firefight?

204
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:13,342
I'll get you where you need,

205
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,428
and then I'm gonna need
to back off.

206
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,602
I appreciate the favor.

207
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,441
I got to stop
doing so many favors.

208
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:34,071
What we doing, Ramsey?

209
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,657
Like, where are we going?

210
00:27:37,616 --> 00:27:39,284
I was able
to decrypt the data

211
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,370
that came through
with Mr. Nobody's SOS,

212
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,497
and I found
GPS coordinates,

213
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,332
definitely included
on purpose.

214
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,294
You knew about Jakob?

215
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:53,090
Question.
Who is Jakob?

216
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,884
Jakob is,

217
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,803
or was, Dom's brother.

218
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:02,933
Oh, my... My bad.

219
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,977
I'm sorry.
I'm just processing.

220
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:07,229
Brother?

221
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,982
You got a brother?

222
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,819
Who also happens to be
some kind of super spy

223
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,779
with his own private army,

224
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,865
who drives literally
like a bat out of hell,

225
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:21,118
who preplanned an aerial jump

226
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,412
and landed
at the bottom of an airplane?

227
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,163
Who does that?

228
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:28,584
Who does that?
A Toretto.

229
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:33,505
That's my dad!
That's my dad!

230
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,550
He's gone! He's gone!

231
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:37,902
We got to get him
out of there.

232
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,345
We got to get him out of there!
That's my dad!

233
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:45,601
That's my dad! That's my dad!

234
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,352
That's my dad!

235
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,187
Get him out of there!

236
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,607
That's my dad!

237
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,865
There's a couple of release
forms we've got to sign.

238
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,242
Few clearances.

239
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:09,207
Everything else is down there
around the corner.

240
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,109
Hey.

241
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,570
Nobody's supposed
to be around here.

242
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,406
You Toretto's other son?

243
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:44,284
You're the useless one, right?

244
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,542
What is that?

245
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,711
Get out of here. Go.

246
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,881
So a man can't pay
his last respects?

247
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,257
That's what that is?

248
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,801
No.

249
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,136
No, not you.
You're the one that killed him.

250
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,513
No, racing killed him.

251
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:08,058
Look, he knew that I was gonna
pit him into the wall. He knew that.

252
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,994
Now, I don't know if he dropped gear.
I don't know.

253
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,229
I swear... I swear to God,

254
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:13,915
- if you don't get out of here...
- What? What?

255
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,315
Go find Buddy.

256
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,067
Now!

257
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,030
Oh.

258
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:25,367
All right, well,
now we got the golden boy.

259
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:30,664
Leave.

260
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,709
You here
to make threats, too?

261
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,253
"Leave" is a simple word.

262
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:38,922
Man, what is it
with you Torettos

263
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,466
where you're all the heroes
in your own stories?

264
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,176
Look, I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

265
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:47,013
You, your dad, me,
we're all stuck,

266
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,183
going round and round
in the same shitty circle.

267
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,269
And we ain't
never getting out.

268
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:57,065
You ain't half the man
my dad was.

269
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,111
- At least I'm alive, asshole.
- What did you say?

270
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:02,237
Get off me!

271
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,282
Dom! Dom!

272
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,450
Dom!

273
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,285
Dom, no! Dom!

274
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,078
No, man!

275
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,014
In here.

276
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,247
Jakob.

277
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,209
I simply cannot believe that
magnet trick actually worked.

278
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:59,961
It looked so damn cool.
Look at this here.

279
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,421
I got this off
the cockpit feed.

280
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,757
Oh, I love being rich.

281
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,759
It was sloppy.
He almost had me.

282
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:08,220
- She say anything?
- Nope<i>. Nada.</i>

283
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,640
You know, I look at her
and I feel creeped out.

284
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,975
And sort of turned on
at the same time.

285
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,019
Is that weird?

286
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:21,024
Nice operation.

287
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,902
You snatched me off
Mr. Nobody's plane midair

288
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,029
without a scratch,
and you took him down.

289
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,532
Money well spent.

290
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,577
- Do you know who I am?
- I know who you are.

291
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,162
Do you?

292
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,251
East L.A. is a tough enough
place to grow up.

293
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:45,757
But it was your brother's shadow
that turned you into this.

294
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:47,509
Isn't it?

295
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:54,140
So your whole life,
you pushed yourself to be faster than Dom.

296
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,142
Smarter than Dom.

297
00:32:57,602 --> 00:32:59,563
Stronger than Dom.

298
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:06,152
Tell me, do you hate him
enough that it keeps you up at night?

299
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,407
Still?

300
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,703
All these years later?

301
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,041
I should've just hired you

302
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:22,669
instead of coercing your brother
a couple of years back.

303
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:24,337
I don't work
for the competition.

304
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,006
That's cute.

305
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,383
You thinking
you're the competition.

306
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:29,843
Says the woman in the box.

307
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,556
Look familiar?

308
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:38,685
The other half's hidden
in one of the agency's thousands of vaults.

309
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,313
I need you
to find out which one.

310
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,692
We secured the master drive here
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

311
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,194
The rest of the hardware
is a bit dated.

312
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:49,279
Pre-Internet.

313
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,866
To make sure you don't go hack
into anything we don't want you to.

314
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,120
Say you get what you're after.

315
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:01,207
A weapon so dangerous
it shouldn't exist for another half century.

316
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:02,667
What would you do with it?

317
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,461
Launch some
global attack?

318
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,963
Sell it to the
highest bidder?

319
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:10,133
Or maybe you see yourself

320
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,552
as a necessary
shock to the system.

321
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:16,222
I bet all you ever wanted
was a hug.

322
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,434
You read my psych eval.
Good for you.

323
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,895
I read your
second-grade report card.

324
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:24,189
That's what I do.

325
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:37,160
Your chin,
it's distinctive.

326
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,498
I know the Torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines,

327
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:44,334
but I never detected
a Nordic strain.

328
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:57,806
Finding the two halves
of Project Aries is the easy part.

329
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,058
Add in your brother Dom
to the mix?

330
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,268
You don't have a chance.

331
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:05,522
Plans are in motion.

332
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,027
Qasar Khan.

333
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:14,572
What?

334
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:16,783
Genghis Khan's little brother.

335
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,247
Nobody's heard of him either.

336
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:49,691
Talk about off the grid.

337
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:53,737
I don't think they had grids
when this place was built.

338
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:58,950
If a Ninja Turtle pop out on me,
tell you right now, I'm out.

339
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:01,828
No way this place
was sanctioned by the agency.

340
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,998
This was definitely
Mr. Nobody's secret hideout.

341
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,591
What now, Dom?

342
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,845
Whoever Jakob has become...

343
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:23,308
...and whatever he's up to...

344
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,481
...it's on me,

345
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:33,109
- and me alone.
- Nah.

346
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:37,030
Whatever's on you,
it's on us.

347
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:38,948
Let's get to work.

348
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,339
That's a rotary phone.

349
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:59,010
Yes. Thank you.
I know what a rotary dial phone is.

350
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:04,182
Okay. Well, what's that?

351
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,601
It's a JX1000
reel-to-reel tape recorder.

352
00:37:06,684 --> 00:37:08,478
What about that?

353
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,775
It's a GB Industries
4K telex machine.

354
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:15,151
Impressive.

355
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:16,236
What about these?

356
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:17,362
They're floppy disks.

357
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:19,697
And that's
a Rafutek micro recorder,

358
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:21,199
that's a Smithson
autoprinter,

359
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:24,494
and that thing there
is an Omaha 3010 fax machine.

360
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:25,787
It's like e-mail,

361
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,288
- but wasteful.
- Mmm.

362
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,332
Are we done here?
Did I pass your little test?

363
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,251
What's your mamma's
phone number?

364
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:35,755
Right.

365
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:44,055
Y'all ever thought about
how many wild missions we've been on?

366
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:46,015
How we somehow

367
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:47,892
always survive?

368
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:48,977
Yeah.

369
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:50,186
So far, so good, I guess.

370
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:51,687
It's just luck.

371
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:53,658
No, no, no, see,
y'all not listening.

372
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:55,358
Think about this.

373
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:59,946
We've now been on insane
missions around the world,

374
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:03,783
doing what most would say
is damn near impossible.

375
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:07,245
And I ain't got
one single scar to show for it?

376
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:09,205
I mean, look at my jacket.

377
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:14,961
Those are bullet holes from 14 dudes
trying to take my head

378
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:16,504
clean off its shoulders.

379
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:19,632
We've taken out cars,
trains, tanks.

380
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:22,260
I'm not gonna even mention
the submarine.

381
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:23,970
And yet we're still here.

382
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:25,847
Exactly.

383
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,027
Ramsey, what happens
when you test a theory

384
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:30,768
over and over again only to come
to the same result?

385
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:33,855
A hypothesis becomes fact.
But you're not actually suggesting that...

386
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:37,817
I don't know, but when
the improbable happens again and again,

387
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:38,943
that's more than luck.

388
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:42,155
Maybe we're not so normal.

389
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,073
That's what I'm saying.

390
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:45,700
We are not normal.

391
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:49,704
Okay, um, just to clarify,

392
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:52,790
are you two maybe suggesting
that we're, what,

393
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,542
invincible?

394
00:38:55,877 --> 00:38:57,962
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

395
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:01,883
Or maybe

396
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,843
you're just a dumbass.

397
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:10,516
Take your dumbass jacket
with you, man.

398
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,777
Pretty impressive driving
out there.

399
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,197
You miss the old life.

400
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:27,909
Do you?

401
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,371
Every day.

402
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:34,457
Guys.

403
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,293
We got a little company.

404
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,629
Think you know this person.

405
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,009
- It's so good to see you.
- I missed you.

406
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:47,887
Thank you.

407
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:49,389
Of course.

408
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:54,727
You should've told me.

409
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:58,189
She deserved to know.

410
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:02,902
Jakob's my brother, too.
I need to be here.

411
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:06,572
You get involved here,
you put everything you have at risk.

412
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:10,994
Your kids and the whole world
that you built.

413
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:13,746
We're all risking something.

414
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:17,417
Dom, listen to me.

415
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:22,130
My kids and yours are in
the safest hands possible.

416
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:23,297
With Brian.

417
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:26,676
Our world's grown, Dom.

418
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:29,804
I got this one.

419
00:40:48,072 --> 00:40:49,240
Guys!

420
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,287
Guys. Get over here.
You gotta come see this.

421
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:58,499
Don't ever say Roman
ain't look out for y'all.

422
00:40:58,583 --> 00:40:59,709
Huh?

423
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,545
Yeah. You get a stack.

424
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:05,798
And you get a stack.
And Roman gets...

425
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:08,926
Roman, this cash
is from Yugoslavia.

426
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:13,181
Yugoslavia hasn't been
a country since 1992.

427
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:15,016
What, you a expert
on history now?

428
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:18,019
No, no, no.
I'm an expert on cash.

429
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:23,649
USD. Huh?

430
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:26,360
Yeah.

431
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:28,863
Professor Dumbass.

432
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:32,408
I just need to find me some luggage
so I can put all this in.

433
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:35,828
The firewall on this old thing
is actually pretty good.

434
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:38,581
But, you know, port scan,
UDP message peek,

435
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:40,500
pop to root shell, and...

436
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:44,879
...say hello to Project Aries.

437
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:46,297
What is it?

438
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,091
It's what we got
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

439
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:49,425
Or at least
part of it.

440
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:53,846
Aries was designed to override
and assimilate anything that runs on code.

441
00:41:54,055 --> 00:41:55,515
Any computer anywhere.

442
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,059
If it operates on zeros and ones,
it's vulnerable.

443
00:41:58,142 --> 00:41:59,227
Aries can own it.

444
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,728
It can
weaponize anything.

445
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:02,313
Someone could
burn your house down

446
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:04,190
with your refrigerator
if they wanted to.

447
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:06,359
Oh, so, now my refrigerator's
gonna kill me?

448
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:07,568
It could be made to.

449
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:09,946
How about my George Foreman Grill
or foot massager?

450
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:12,532
Y'all...

451
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:15,376
Do you know how it feels to create
something that could end the world?

452
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,411
No.

453
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:18,955
Well, I do.

454
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:21,541
And this will.

455
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,544
If you take Aries
and upload it to a satellite,

456
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:26,212
it'll spread like a virus.

457
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,340
Then it'll be a matter of time
before someone can control

458
00:42:29,423 --> 00:42:33,594
any weapon system, traditional, nuclear,
stuff we haven't even seen yet,

459
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:35,471
and just point it
wherever they want.

460
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:41,018
Jakob reboots
the world order within minutes.

461
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:43,896
Ares is
the god of war, right?

462
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:46,357
If Jakob gets his hands
on this,

463
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:48,901
he'll be the god
of damn near everything.

464
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:51,337
Because of how
dangerous it was,

465
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:55,241
the Aries prototype was recovered
and split into two halves by Mr. Nobody.

466
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,952
Both of which are worthless
without the activation key.

467
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:01,122
Jakob now has
one of the pieces.

468
00:43:01,205 --> 00:43:03,374
He'll be going
after the other half next.

469
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:04,917
As for the key, it's...

470
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,711
It's vanished.

471
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:07,795
So, we find it.

472
00:43:08,296 --> 00:43:09,881
If we're gonna beat
Jakob to it,

473
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:11,424
we're gonna
have to split up.

474
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:15,136
Roman, Tej, I know a couple of guys
operating out of Germany

475
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:16,846
that could get us
anything we need.

476
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:19,307
- I'm on it.
- Wait, there's one more thing.

477
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,227
Mr. Nobody's transmission had
one name connected to the key.

478
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:26,022
You guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this.

479
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:33,946
No way.

480
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:36,115
That's exactly
what I said.

481
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:39,869
So you're saying Han's death
is connected to all of this?

482
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:42,038
He has to have
something to do with it.

483
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:43,497
I'll look into it.

484
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:46,542
Tej, can you send me
all the files you have on Han?

485
00:43:46,626 --> 00:43:48,210
- Yeah.
- I'll go with you.

486
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:51,005
Letty.

487
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:55,426
I got this the day Han died.

488
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:57,345
Mexico.

489
00:43:58,429 --> 00:43:59,639
Check the postmark.

490
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,892
Whatever he was up to,
it ended here.

491
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:05,353
Tokyo.

492
00:44:06,187 --> 00:44:07,980
What are you gonna do
about Jakob?

493
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:10,858
I'm gonna find him.

494
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:14,695
How?

495
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:17,198
An old friend.

496
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,919
Yo, what do you think?

497
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:51,107
It doesn't matter.

498
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:53,734
It's all about how
you choose to see it.

499
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:55,820
Shit.
I told you I was right.

500
00:44:57,238 --> 00:44:59,073
- I'm Leo.
- Santos.

501
00:44:59,198 --> 00:45:01,659
Dom. What are you guys in for?

502
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:02,952
Driving while brown.

503
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:15,965
You see that?

504
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,758
Hairline crack
in the fuel line.

505
00:45:17,883 --> 00:45:20,094
Air gets in there,
you got a lean condition.

506
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:21,887
Lean condition?

507
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,572
<i>I got a taste for wasting
and tasting the blood</i>

508
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,299
<i>Murder, I heard her
when she screamed and dropped</i>

509
00:45:41,323 --> 00:45:42,742
<i>'Cause her son caught the slug</i>

510
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:44,243
<i>Relate this to no choice</i>

511
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:45,911
<i>And listen to this</i>
s <i>traight-up man</i>

512
00:45:45,995 --> 00:45:47,204
<i>Before they ban the voice</i>

513
00:45:47,288 --> 00:45:48,873
<i>While I rhyme
to the rhythm</i> o <i>f a pop</i>

514
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:50,416
<i>Remember the first brother
to run</i>

515
00:45:50,499 --> 00:45:51,709
<i>Is the first to get shot</i>

516
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,252
<i>Whoever said
that what I say</i>

517
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:54,920
<i>And portray is negativity</i>

518
00:45:55,046 --> 00:45:56,964
<i>Need to come kick it
in the city with me</i>

519
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:59,508
<i>And find the black and crack
in fact, they take that back</i>

520
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:01,272
<i>Because they really can't
deal with that...</i>

521
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:03,596
Hey.

522
00:46:04,263 --> 00:46:06,057
You had another
eight months.

523
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:08,517
Good behavior.

524
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:15,566
Oh, Dom.

525
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:18,819
You didn't call.

526
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:22,239
I would have
picked you up.

527
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:24,492
I'm here now.

528
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:30,372
Welcome home,
brother.

529
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:33,793
Come here.

530
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,593
Yeah! Yeah, Jakob!

531
00:46:42,676 --> 00:46:43,677
Whoo!

532
00:46:43,761 --> 00:46:46,097
That's what
I'm talking about!

533
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,473
How you doin'?

534
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:51,185
Who wants next?

535
00:46:51,936 --> 00:46:53,395
I said, who wants next?

536
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:54,563
I got next.

537
00:46:57,316 --> 00:46:58,609
Dom.

538
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:01,612
Well, when'd you get out, man?

539
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:03,781
I said I got next.

540
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:06,951
Come on, Dom.

541
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:10,788
You don't want to race me
in Buddy's old Charger.

542
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,623
No, it won't even be close.

543
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:15,626
My Mustang?
With all the mods that I put in it?

544
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:17,545
Car don't make the driver.

545
00:47:25,594 --> 00:47:27,138
Here's how this goes.

546
00:47:27,763 --> 00:47:28,973
You win,

547
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,350
you come back home.

548
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:33,644
You lose,

549
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:37,106
you keep driving,
you don't stop,

550
00:47:37,189 --> 00:47:38,941
you don't ever come back.

551
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,110
Ever.

552
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:43,988
What do you mean, Dom?

553
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:45,489
I know what you did.

554
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:51,412
The day we lost him,
Dad kept talking about a misfire.

555
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:52,955
Remember?

556
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:56,584
You were the last one
under his hood that day.

557
00:47:59,044 --> 00:48:00,796
A minute later, he was gone.

558
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,592
Tell me
why you killed Dad.

559
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:13,517
Now let's race.

560
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:20,691
Armed robbery in Echo Park.

561
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:22,401
Fourth Street Bridge is open.

562
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:23,527
Clear, clear, clear!

563
00:48:43,464 --> 00:48:44,673
Ready?

564
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:46,884
Set.

565
00:48:48,385 --> 00:48:49,470
Go.

566
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:52,574
<i>Set the time
for the battleground</i>

567
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:54,308
<i>Guided missiles
will hunt you down</i>

568
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:55,601
<i>Drones surrounding your home</i>

569
00:48:55,684 --> 00:48:57,686
<i>Don't breathe, you're not
safe underground</i>

570
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,773
<i>Political landscape shape
has been polarized</i>

571
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:02,358
<i>Now it's time
to reveal the zeal</i>

572
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,984
<i>Everybody breathe,
get mobilized</i>

573
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:06,237
<i>Trying to buy
the American dream</i>

574
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,488
<i>But it's overpriced</i>

575
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:09,198
<i>Five-bil deal
for the fighterjets</i>

576
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:10,741
<i>Being shipped
to the Middle East</i>

577
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:12,534
<i>It'll cost ten billion
more dollars</i>

578
00:49:12,618 --> 00:49:14,058
<i>For neighbors to feel safe
to breathe</i>

579
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:16,205
<i>What, what</i>

580
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:21,335
<i>- What, what
- Breathe with me</i>

581
00:49:21,418 --> 00:49:22,586
<i>What</i>

582
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,631
<i>Sometimes we got to stop
and breathe</i>

583
00:49:43,399 --> 00:49:44,608
<i>Stop, breathe</i>

584
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:58,330
<i>Breathe with me</i>

585
00:49:59,248 --> 00:50:01,542
<i>Sometimes we got to stop
and breathe</i>

586
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:15,514
Too soon.

587
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:25,190
No!

588
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,766
<i>Green light,
we gon' ride the night</i>

589
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:00,351
<i>Loud pipes,
we gon' ride the night</i>

590
00:51:00,476 --> 00:51:02,311
<i>Fishtailing out
the parking lot</i>

591
00:51:02,394 --> 00:51:04,146
<i>No cops,
we ain't gonna stop</i>

592
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:05,981
<i>Switch gears,
we gon' drag and drift</i>

593
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:07,733
<i>Hit the gas
and we pack the clip</i>

594
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:10,110
<i>Muscle cars sound mad
as hell</i>

595
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:13,655
<i>- Whoa, whoa
- Whoa, whoa</i>

596
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:17,451
<i>- Na-na-na, whoa
- Na-na-na, whoa.</i>

597
00:51:17,618 --> 00:51:19,698
<i>...and beating the shortstop.</i>

598
00:51:21,538 --> 00:51:23,207
<i>Line drive
over the head of Gonzalez</i>

599
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,125
<i>on the field for a base hit.</i>

600
00:51:27,378 --> 00:51:28,545
<i>Up next...</i>

601
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:33,467
Place still
looks the same.

602
00:51:35,636 --> 00:51:37,429
Just like
your dad left it.

603
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:39,890
I'm looking for Jakob.

604
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,728
Can't help you, man.

605
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:49,608
I know you took Jakob in
after my father died.

606
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:53,404
The worst thing
you can do to a Toretto

607
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:55,364
is take away their family.

608
00:51:57,074 --> 00:51:58,909
That's what you did to Jakob.

609
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:01,787
You've got people
who love you,

610
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,373
count on you,
care for you.

611
00:52:04,832 --> 00:52:06,375
He ain't got no one.

612
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,543
You get in his way,

613
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:10,421
this ain't gonna end
until one of you guys are in the ground.

614
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,923
I know you did the best
you could, Buddy.

615
00:52:14,508 --> 00:52:17,678
But we both know
he's about to cause a lot of hurt.

616
00:52:30,399 --> 00:52:32,776
I did my best
to take care of Jakob.

617
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:36,780
But I'm no Jack Toretto.

618
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:56,925
You've got to make peace
with the past if you...

619
00:52:58,677 --> 00:53:01,180
If you want hope
for the future.

620
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:10,355
He's in London.

621
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:12,733
That's all I know.

622
00:53:23,744 --> 00:53:25,204
Dom.

623
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,918
I hope you find your peace.

624
00:53:34,004 --> 00:53:37,049
The chance for peace died
that day on the track.

625
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:10,290
Han's old shop.

626
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:15,379
God! It looks like this place has been
picked over a thousand times.

627
00:54:15,837 --> 00:54:18,674
- Gotta start somewhere.
- It doesn't make any sense.

628
00:54:18,757 --> 00:54:20,092
I mean,
Han ends up in Tokyo

629
00:54:20,175 --> 00:54:22,844
and he's supposed
to have something to do with the key?

630
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,239
But police records
make it sound like

631
00:54:24,263 --> 00:54:26,890
he was running around
with a bunch of small time crooks.

632
00:54:28,308 --> 00:54:30,560
Don't mock it.
That's how we started.

633
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:33,397
Maybe Han was looking
for a change of scenery

634
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,023
after Gisele died.

635
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:37,484
People mourn
in different ways.

636
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,945
Letty, how did Mr. Nobody
get connected with Han?

637
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:41,905
And they never...

638
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:43,865
They never
crossed paths unless...

639
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:44,950
Gisele.

640
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:47,536
She's former Mossad.

641
00:54:48,078 --> 00:54:49,997
Mr. Nobody is a spy.

642
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,040
They could have run
in the same circles.

643
00:54:52,124 --> 00:54:55,502
There's Mossad clearance
all over the files Mr. Nobody had on Han.

644
00:54:56,169 --> 00:54:58,046
Mission spikes
going back to Mexico,

645
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:01,049
which is where Gisele was working
when she met Dom and Brian.

646
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:03,510
Gisele's gotta be the link.

647
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:08,140
Leave it to Mr. Nobody
to confuse everyone.

648
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:13,770
This place is a dead end.
Let's get out of here.

649
00:55:14,146 --> 00:55:15,689
I'll check in with
Tej and Roman.

650
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:18,942
<i>I'm a lane switcher</i>

651
00:55:19,026 --> 00:55:20,861
<i>Big tank, bank filler</i>

652
00:55:20,944 --> 00:55:23,739
<i>Real killer,
die for my gang member</i>

653
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:25,532
<i>Gun driller,
dope man dope dealer</i>

654
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,202
<i>Gorilla, bang, bang,
lane switcher...</i>

655
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,705
She's ready to roll.

656
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,207
No. No!

657
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,917
No, Sean!

658
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:38,730
Tell me you are not modding
the quick disconnect valve on the LOX line.

659
00:55:38,754 --> 00:55:39,963
Hey, man, chill out.

660
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:41,256
All right? It's all good.

661
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,176
- That tweak just saved us 0.4 seconds.
- "All good"?

662
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:45,844
This isn't <i>Top Gun,</i> Maverick.

663
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,527
You don't follow
the rules here, you die.

664
00:55:47,554 --> 00:55:49,639
Hey, come on.
That's a bit much.

665
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:52,642
When you know what too much pressure
in the LOX line can do,

666
00:55:52,726 --> 00:55:54,811
come talk to me.
Till then, stay in your lane.

667
00:55:54,895 --> 00:55:56,730
Yo, you're lucky
to even be in my lane.

668
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:58,693
In case you forgot,
I'm the one that figured out

669
00:55:58,774 --> 00:56:01,068
how to let us build
rocket engines and get paid.

670
00:56:01,151 --> 00:56:03,528
This whole thing was my idea.

671
00:56:03,612 --> 00:56:05,906
So who are you gonna trust
with your brilliant idea,

672
00:56:05,989 --> 00:56:07,699
this glorified mechanic

673
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,868
or a rocket scientist?

674
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:12,454
Without me,
you'd be working at Jiffy Lube.

675
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:14,289
Guys, guys.
Look, it's all good.

676
00:56:14,373 --> 00:56:15,499
Who cares about
who did what?

677
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:16,958
Kind of hard
for you to do anything

678
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:19,082
when you pee your pants
every time you fly, Twinkie.

679
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:20,504
Did I hear that right?

680
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,298
You a runner
and you afraid of flying?

681
00:56:25,092 --> 00:56:26,510
"Twinkie"?

682
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:30,472
So, you must be Ding Dong
and Sno Ball.

683
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:32,265
- Right?
- Yo... Uh-uh.

684
00:56:32,933 --> 00:56:34,476
I don't go
by that name anymore.

685
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,603
You went by
that name ever?

686
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:37,938
Like, ever?

687
00:56:38,355 --> 00:56:39,439
I... That's...

688
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:43,443
- Hey! We're up.
- Oh, good.

689
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:46,530
Hey, fellas.

690
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,490
Y'all seen ten-second cars?

691
00:56:49,658 --> 00:56:52,994
Well, say hello
to the two-second car.

692
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:03,004
Is that a Pontiac Fiero

693
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,132
strapped to
a rocket engine?

694
00:57:05,215 --> 00:57:06,925
Impressive, I know.

695
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:08,343
No.

696
00:57:08,427 --> 00:57:09,886
No, that's not impressive.

697
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,349
Eyes up! Here it comes!
Let the race begin!

698
00:57:31,408 --> 00:57:32,492
Plane's taking off!

699
00:57:32,576 --> 00:57:33,743
Go, go, go, go!

700
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:51,470
Yes!

701
00:57:53,805 --> 00:57:54,848
We did it!

702
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:02,731
Uh...

703
00:58:02,814 --> 00:58:04,316
I'm confused.

704
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,818
Y'all didn't actually
beat the jet.

705
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,570
It didn't explode.

706
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,614
- Yeah, or melt.
- Yeah.

707
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:12,115
She's still
in one piece.

708
00:58:18,413 --> 00:58:19,664
You mean "pieces"?

709
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:23,502
Hey, Jiffy Lube, next time,
will you listen to me?

710
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:27,380
Look, we heard
y'all could get us some wheels.

711
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:30,175
Preferably the kind
that don't explode.

712
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:32,135
Is that possible?

713
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:35,138
Well, the Honda dealership's
about 3,000 miles that way.

714
00:58:35,472 --> 00:58:37,098
Dominic Toretto sent us.

715
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:46,566
Who's Dominic Toretto?

716
00:58:55,242 --> 00:58:56,701
<i>Arigato.</i>

717
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,581
This place is a dead end.

718
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:04,543
Do you think Jakob could be
onto the Han connection?

719
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,671
If he has all the information
we do, probably.

720
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:14,135
I never told Dom,

721
00:59:16,263 --> 00:59:19,140
I stayed in touch with him
for a while after what happened.

722
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:23,436
He was over at Buddy's
for about a year, and then

723
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:25,897
he was gone,
with a message not to follow.

724
00:59:26,982 --> 00:59:29,317
But after he disappeared,
I was so desperate to find him

725
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:31,903
that I would've...
Would've done anything.

726
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:35,657
I even broke into a police archive,
but I didn't find anything.

727
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:36,992
You what?

728
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:38,660
You were, like, 16.

729
00:59:40,245 --> 00:59:41,746
I did what I had to do.

730
00:59:42,998 --> 00:59:44,291
Yeah.

731
00:59:47,586 --> 00:59:48,962
How about you?

732
00:59:49,588 --> 00:59:50,880
How are you doing?

733
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:53,300
It's a change of pace, huh?

734
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:57,345
Just as I was remembering...

735
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:00,807
...who I was,

736
01:00:01,433 --> 01:00:03,018
everything changed.

737
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:05,979
It slowed down.

738
01:00:07,439 --> 01:00:09,566
There's peace for me
in the chaos.

739
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:14,404
It's like I... I need to face the world
head-on or something to feel alive.

740
01:00:16,323 --> 01:00:18,241
Seeing Little Brian

741
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,828
hiding in a hole because we had
unexpected company

742
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:24,956
that got to me.

743
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,460
We never used to hide.

744
01:00:31,046 --> 01:00:34,174
Hey, Dom's my brother,
but you will always be my sister.

745
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:38,345
Funny how we all have secrets.

746
01:00:45,268 --> 01:00:46,436
What?

747
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:48,271
You got to be kidding me.

748
01:00:49,189 --> 01:00:50,440
What is it?

749
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:52,567
Remember what Han
used to say about Tokyo?

750
01:00:55,528 --> 01:00:57,447
You mean how,
in all the old Westerns,

751
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,617
cowboys would make a run for the border
to get away from the law,

752
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,285
how Tokyo was his...

753
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:03,370
Mexico.

754
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:08,875
No way.

755
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:02,804
Hmm.

756
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:07,267
Nice necklace,
Queenie.

757
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:11,604
Diamonds and emeralds
never looked so good.

758
01:02:12,439 --> 01:02:14,315
Dominic Toretto.

759
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:19,195
The word on the street
is you got locked up.

760
01:02:19,279 --> 01:02:21,489
Yeah, well, in and out,
you know.

761
01:02:22,282 --> 01:02:23,867
When are they gonna learn

762
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:26,244
some birds
can't be caged?

763
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,288
Are you looking
for one of me sons?

764
01:02:29,622 --> 01:02:30,957
Not tonight.

765
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,753
You do the driving,
I'll cut you in for 15%.

766
01:02:39,174 --> 01:02:41,054
My thieving days are over.

767
01:02:42,385 --> 01:02:43,761
Mine ain't.

768
01:02:45,597 --> 01:02:46,806
You coming?

769
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,215
I'm looking for someone.

770
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:22,800
Would've shown up in town
a little while ago.

771
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:26,429
A lot of guys,
a lot of resources.

772
01:03:26,513 --> 01:03:29,516
Oh, yeah, yeah, word did go round
on a crew that just turned up,

773
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:30,850
led by an American.

774
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,317
Yeah, he bought some arms
off a local seller.

775
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,986
Rumor had it he was
into something big up in Edinburgh.

776
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,701
Local seller, huh?

777
01:03:49,536 --> 01:03:52,163
She wouldn't happen to be wearing
a stolen necklace, would she?

778
01:03:52,247 --> 01:03:54,874
He paid well. What was I
supposed to do?

779
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:02,048
This geezer was about
your height, actually.

780
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:04,050
Similar features.

781
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:07,929
Oh, bloody hell, he's not your cousin
or something, is he?

782
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:09,889
He's my brother.

783
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,651
Get the hand brake for me,
would you, darling?

784
01:04:24,988 --> 01:04:27,782
Glad I'm not the only one
with a family full of eccentrics.

785
01:04:29,826 --> 01:04:31,578
He offered payment
for something else.

786
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:35,498
You.

787
01:04:48,595 --> 01:04:51,764
<i>I am the thorn in your crown</i>

788
01:04:56,227 --> 01:04:59,022
<i>Veneno you hold in your mouth</i>

789
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:01,774
<i>That you won't spit out</i>

790
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:06,613
You know, nothing's
more powerful than the love of family.

791
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,116
But you turn that
into anger and resentment,

792
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:12,869
nothing's more dangerous.

793
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:19,542
Dom?

794
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:21,961
Don't get yourself
killed, okay?

795
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:24,130
You're my favorite American.

796
01:05:48,237 --> 01:05:50,114
Dominic Toretto.

797
01:05:50,198 --> 01:05:52,116
Tell me.
Why is the best fruit

798
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,660
always forbidden?

799
01:05:54,327 --> 01:05:55,787
You should know.

800
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:56,871
Mmm.

801
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:02,251
This is your kind of party,
isn't it, Dom?

802
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:05,546
Beautiful women, best cars,
best everything.

803
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,215
You know,
best security, too.

804
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,133
I'm Otto. I'm your
brother's partner.

805
01:06:14,764 --> 01:06:16,224
Well, financier.

806
01:06:17,058 --> 01:06:18,601
But, you know, my dad,
he's a dictator,

807
01:06:18,685 --> 01:06:20,561
so we're not talking
regular people rich here.

808
01:06:20,645 --> 01:06:23,231
No, no, no, no, no.
Everything you see here, I own.

809
01:06:23,314 --> 01:06:25,149
These girls, if you want
to meet one of them,

810
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:27,819
maybe two, maybe three, just let me know.
They're on the payroll.

811
01:06:27,902 --> 01:06:30,822
I offer a bomb-ass
dental plan, too. Huh?

812
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,115
Where is Jakob?

813
01:06:32,657 --> 01:06:33,783
He's inside.

814
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,159
The brother
you're looking for,

815
01:07:17,034 --> 01:07:18,536
he's from an old life.

816
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:21,247
He's long gone.

817
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:24,917
All I see is the same scared little kid
that killed our father.

818
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:28,504
That's your mistake.

819
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,508
The spy game,

820
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:35,344
this is my world.

821
01:07:40,725 --> 01:07:41,952
What do you think
happened, Dom,

822
01:07:41,976 --> 01:07:44,020
every time you
took somebody down?

823
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:47,356
Their territory just
stayed crime-free?

824
01:07:49,317 --> 01:07:51,819
The Trans, Braga...

825
01:07:53,196 --> 01:07:54,572
The Shaws...

826
01:07:56,199 --> 01:07:57,700
Cipher.

827
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:00,077
You paved the way for me.

828
01:08:00,995 --> 01:08:02,371
So here's my offer.

829
01:08:03,122 --> 01:08:04,999
It's the same one you gave me.

830
01:08:07,752 --> 01:08:08,920
You leave.

831
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:10,338
Now.

832
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:14,842
You drive away,
and you never come back.

833
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,803
Ever.

834
01:08:17,553 --> 01:08:18,596
A deal?

835
01:08:20,056 --> 01:08:21,724
I showed you mercy!

836
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:25,853
And I won't show it
to you again.

837
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,406
Toretto.

838
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:40,701
Since my dad
is head of state,

839
01:08:41,536 --> 01:08:43,663
it makes me
a foreign dignitary

840
01:08:43,746 --> 01:08:46,290
and this place
an embassy.

841
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:50,711
Which means you just trespassed
into my country and attempted murder.

842
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:54,799
So, naturally, I called in a little favor
with all my good friends from INTERPOL.

843
01:08:55,174 --> 01:08:58,219
You keep digging around
in the past, Dom,

844
01:08:58,344 --> 01:09:00,346
you're not gonna like
what you find.

845
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:10,982
And here I thought my dad
was a pain in the ass.

846
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:14,944
But your family
is a train wreck.

847
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:18,739
Well, now that your brother's
finally out of the game,

848
01:09:18,823 --> 01:09:20,533
it's time
we go to Edinburgh.

849
01:09:20,867 --> 01:09:24,328
Get the second piece,
maybe do a little sightseeing, huh?

850
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:27,915
Any news on the key?

851
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:29,876
Don't worry about it.
Our men are closing in.

852
01:09:32,044 --> 01:09:35,882
One week from now,
there won't be a superpower in the world

853
01:09:35,965 --> 01:09:37,925
can take a piss
without our permission.

854
01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:41,095
One week from now, your dad will be
asking you for an allowance.

855
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:42,889
I'd like that.

856
01:09:44,682 --> 01:09:45,892
I'd like that.

857
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:01,365
Whew.

858
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:03,659
What's up?

859
01:10:04,702 --> 01:10:07,121
- Well done, Leysa.
- Please.

860
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:10,416
If it wasn't for you,
I'd still be stealing gas in the D.R.

861
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:12,209
So Queenie
treating you right?

862
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:13,836
Like a <i>princesa.</i>

863
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:15,504
I'm her number-one pick,
you know.

864
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:18,090
- Cara's little sister done good.
- Good?

865
01:10:18,174 --> 01:10:20,343
You saw my fine ass
in that white dress.

866
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:21,886
You see how
I been rocking shit?

867
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:24,805
All this crew,
this is mine. Huh?

868
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:26,599
I been around the world.

869
01:10:26,682 --> 01:10:28,309
Oh, I almost forgot,

870
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:29,727
you might need this.

871
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:32,688
Your boy Jakob biometrics
are encoded to this gun.

872
01:10:32,772 --> 01:10:35,399
You'll have no trouble
tracking him now.

873
01:11:13,354 --> 01:11:14,522
Hey, Letty.

874
01:11:15,982 --> 01:11:16,983
Yeah.

875
01:11:17,066 --> 01:11:18,275
Come look at this.

876
01:11:19,568 --> 01:11:20,569
What the hell?

877
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:23,739
Han never mentioned
a girl, not ever.

878
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:26,659
Letty, Mia!

879
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:28,931
Down, now!

880
01:13:24,652 --> 01:13:25,986
You okay?

881
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:31,218
Welcome
to St. Giles' Cathedral of Edinburgh.

882
01:14:31,302 --> 01:14:35,681
The High Kirk has a history
stretching back over 900 years.

883
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:38,559
Renowned for its
stained glass windows,

884
01:14:38,642 --> 01:14:41,061
you can see the intricate
craftsmanship...

885
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:46,192
We're a go.

886
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,159
Ramsey, talk to me.
What do we got?

887
01:14:55,242 --> 01:14:57,369
I pulled Jakob's biometric
signature off the gun,

888
01:14:57,453 --> 01:15:00,623
and the algorithm I've run
says Jakob's team is right on top of us.

889
01:15:00,706 --> 01:15:02,791
Anywhere between
80 and 100 meters.

890
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:04,210
Eighty meters?

891
01:15:04,293 --> 01:15:05,753
That's a lot around here.

892
01:15:06,337 --> 01:15:08,380
This whole area
seems pretty packed in.

893
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:10,883
So, we don't know...

894
01:15:10,966 --> 01:15:13,778
<i>where the secret vault facility
Jakob is looking to hit is,</i>

895
01:15:13,802 --> 01:15:14,929
<i>now, do we?</i>

896
01:15:15,012 --> 01:15:16,889
Wouldn't be a secret
if we did.

897
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,742
<i>You know what?</i>

898
01:15:18,766 --> 01:15:20,768
<i>I'm starting to think
your little English accent</i>

899
01:15:20,893 --> 01:15:22,937
<i>makes you sound
smarter than you are.</i>

900
01:15:28,442 --> 01:15:31,320
Man, can I point out
that a good old-fashioned tracking chip

901
01:15:31,403 --> 01:15:33,447
would've put us within,
like, six feet of this dude?

902
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:35,741
But, nah, instead,
we out here with biometrics

903
01:15:35,824 --> 01:15:37,534
and facial recognition
imaging.

904
01:15:37,743 --> 01:15:41,455
Feels like we looking for
Where's Waldo in Harry Potter world.

905
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,290
Yeah, uh,
strong argument there,

906
01:15:43,374 --> 01:15:45,292
Tej, but tracking chips
follow the chip.

907
01:15:45,376 --> 01:15:47,753
Before we know it,
we'd be chasing some expensive

908
01:15:47,836 --> 01:15:49,755
yet tacky jacket
to the dry cleaner's.

909
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:52,508
Biometrics, on the other hand,
are impossible to...

910
01:15:54,009 --> 01:15:55,803
Wait.

911
01:15:55,886 --> 01:15:57,680
Guys, okay,
we have a problem.

912
01:15:57,763 --> 01:16:01,267
Cameras are going down all around us,
and my equipment is freaking out.

913
01:16:03,394 --> 01:16:04,895
What the hell, Jimmy?

914
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:07,439
Security alert.
Cameras are down.

915
01:16:10,109 --> 01:16:11,402
Damn.

916
01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:12,861
You see anything suspicious?

917
01:16:13,195 --> 01:16:14,822
Uh, where do I start?

918
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:18,158
First of all, all of this
looks a little spooky.

919
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:20,619
I even seen these
two ladies walking

920
01:16:20,703 --> 01:16:24,081
with George Washington wigs
on their head from the 1700s.

921
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:26,917
I feel like I'm in Transylvania
or some damn where.

922
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,408
<i>Ramsey,
we're looking everywhere.</i>

923
01:16:41,432 --> 01:16:42,933
<i>I just grew a new bunion.</i>

924
01:16:43,267 --> 01:16:44,601
This is hopeless.

925
01:16:46,478 --> 01:16:47,646
What?

926
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:49,606
- You see that?
- See what?

927
01:16:49,857 --> 01:16:50,983
The ears.

928
01:16:51,483 --> 01:16:53,193
They got cauliflower ears.

929
01:16:53,444 --> 01:16:54,945
They fight for a living.

930
01:16:57,031 --> 01:16:58,991
- Don't worry about it.
- Roman.

931
01:16:59,283 --> 01:17:01,994
Hey, man, I ordered
a pair of Crocs.

932
01:17:02,077 --> 01:17:04,538
three weeks ago,
and I'm still waiting!

933
01:17:08,959 --> 01:17:10,627
Where are my shoes, man?

934
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:15,841
Man, we really need
to work on your planning.

935
01:17:17,301 --> 01:17:20,095
Hey, Dom, you should
get down to the cathedral.

936
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:22,348
Dumbass here just attacked
some delivery dudes

937
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:24,016
'cause he didn't like
their ears.

938
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:27,436
Wait, wait, wait.

939
01:17:27,519 --> 01:17:29,772
How much did you say
you paid for that again?

940
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:33,025
You know silver
ain't magnetic, right?

941
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:35,569
You know what? Just shut up.

942
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:36,779
Just shut up.

943
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:41,325
Ramsey, say we had a big electromagnet
turned up right around here.

944
01:17:41,992 --> 01:17:44,244
Wouldn't that disrupt
all electronic signals?

945
01:17:44,328 --> 01:17:46,997
Including security systems.
That's it.

946
01:17:47,081 --> 01:17:49,083
That's how Jakob's
getting into the vault.

947
01:17:53,253 --> 01:17:54,505
<i>Guys?</i>

948
01:17:55,214 --> 01:17:56,298
<i>Guys?</i>

949
01:17:59,259 --> 01:18:01,512
Okay, we've got police
coming from all sides.

950
01:18:01,595 --> 01:18:04,473
- The area's locking down.
- He ain't using roads.

951
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:20,906
I got eyes on Jakob.

952
01:18:29,415 --> 01:18:30,624
I see Otto.

953
01:18:32,751 --> 01:18:34,169
I'm gonna tail him.

954
01:18:43,262 --> 01:18:45,305
He's heading towards
a blue Jaguar.

955
01:18:45,389 --> 01:18:46,473
Okay, follow him.

956
01:18:46,557 --> 01:18:48,517
Me? I can't.

957
01:18:48,809 --> 01:18:49,810
Why not?

958
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:51,853
<i>Okay, this is
a bad time to tell you this,</i>

959
01:18:52,312 --> 01:18:53,605
but I don't drive. Okay?

960
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:55,691
I never got my license.
I don't know how to drive.

961
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:57,818
And, you know,
no one really drives in London.

962
01:18:57,901 --> 01:19:00,362
Okay? And that is not
my contribution to this group.

963
01:19:00,446 --> 01:19:01,530
It's you or no one.

964
01:19:14,877 --> 01:19:16,086
Shit.

965
01:19:16,545 --> 01:19:19,381
Guys, come on, man.
I feel like, between the six of us,

966
01:19:19,465 --> 01:19:20,966
we can work
this out, right?

967
01:19:30,392 --> 01:19:31,685
Okay. I've got...

968
01:19:39,193 --> 01:19:40,694
Ramsey, shut it off!

969
01:19:41,153 --> 01:19:42,154
Shut it off!

970
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:45,282
Go, go, go!

971
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,408
Okay.

972
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,869
Brake is on the left,
accelerator right.

973
01:20:45,676 --> 01:20:46,677
Shit.

974
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,431
Hey!

975
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:05,946
Oh. Sorry!

976
01:21:24,089 --> 01:21:25,090
Whoa!

977
01:21:50,157 --> 01:21:51,158
Oh, no!

978
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:55,245
Move!

979
01:21:55,537 --> 01:21:57,122
Hey, that was not my fault!

980
01:22:06,048 --> 01:22:07,924
Okay, that one was my fault.

981
01:22:43,377 --> 01:22:44,503
See?

982
01:22:44,586 --> 01:22:46,046
What'd I tell you?

983
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:47,506
Not even a scratch.

984
01:23:01,895 --> 01:23:03,689
Otto, sending you
new pickup location.

985
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:13,490
I've got it.
I'm headed to you now.

986
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:54,698
Otto, where are you?

987
01:23:54,948 --> 01:23:56,700
Jakob, I'm there.
I don't see anybody.

988
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:01,121
It's because you're
on the wrong street.

989
01:24:35,405 --> 01:24:36,823
That's my car, pal!

990
01:24:36,907 --> 01:24:37,991
Dom!

991
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:43,497
Go!

992
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,543
Damn it.

993
01:25:20,534 --> 01:25:21,660
You're a natural.

994
01:25:21,952 --> 01:25:23,995
Of course I am.

995
01:25:37,551 --> 01:25:38,844
Okay, listen up!

996
01:25:38,969 --> 01:25:40,595
I want 50 of the best men!

997
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:41,680
I want guns!

998
01:25:41,763 --> 01:25:45,058
I want wheels,
freaking X-wing fighters, I don't care!

999
01:25:45,141 --> 01:25:48,019
The <i>Millennium Falcon,</i>
Chewbacca if you can get ahold of him.

1000
01:25:48,103 --> 01:25:49,646
Money's no object. Go.

1001
01:25:50,522 --> 01:25:51,773
Go!

1002
01:26:01,825 --> 01:26:03,118
What?

1003
01:26:05,287 --> 01:26:06,746
What's so funny?

1004
01:26:07,747 --> 01:26:08,915
I...

1005
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:12,961
I was thinking,
if this was a movie,

1006
01:26:13,378 --> 01:26:14,713
this would be the moment

1007
01:26:14,796 --> 01:26:18,091
where the villain
has an unexpected setback,

1008
01:26:18,216 --> 01:26:20,760
overcompensates without
thinking it through

1009
01:26:20,886 --> 01:26:22,929
and gets crushed
by the good guys.

1010
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,852
No offense, but you have no idea
what we're about to do.

1011
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:32,147
And, for the record,
we're the good guys.

1012
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:34,649
Me? I'm Luke
freaking Skywalker.

1013
01:26:34,941 --> 01:26:36,443
Are you sure about that?

1014
01:26:37,277 --> 01:26:39,487
I mean, I get
the daddy issues, but...

1015
01:26:41,531 --> 01:26:43,116
Look at what you've built.

1016
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:46,578
Really? Luke?

1017
01:26:47,954 --> 01:26:49,247
You're right.

1018
01:26:49,831 --> 01:26:51,625
No, I'm more of a Han Solo.

1019
01:26:52,751 --> 01:26:53,960
No.

1020
01:26:56,630 --> 01:26:57,714
You're Yoda.

1021
01:26:58,006 --> 01:26:59,257
- Yoda?
- Mm-hmm.

1022
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:01,343
No. The little green guy?

1023
01:27:01,426 --> 01:27:02,636
- Yeah.
- No.

1024
01:27:04,054 --> 01:27:05,972
Ah, shit, I'll take it.

1025
01:27:06,681 --> 01:27:08,975
Because he's
a powerful Jedi, right?

1026
01:27:09,059 --> 01:27:10,226
No.

1027
01:27:11,227 --> 01:27:12,270
Yoda's a puppet.

1028
01:27:14,898 --> 01:27:17,275
With someone's hand
up his ass.

1029
01:27:41,508 --> 01:27:42,717
So, what now, Dom?

1030
01:27:43,385 --> 01:27:45,345
No one outruns their past.

1031
01:27:46,179 --> 01:27:47,764
And yours just
caught up to you.

1032
01:27:57,691 --> 01:27:58,775
Man.

1033
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:02,195
There is literally zero industrial
or weapons-grade electromagnets

1034
01:28:02,278 --> 01:28:04,114
I can find that
are this powerful.

1035
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:05,782
Look at the pull strength
level here.

1036
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:07,367
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

1037
01:28:08,576 --> 01:28:09,786
Wait, watch this.

1038
01:28:27,137 --> 01:28:28,722
Every time.
I can't believe it.

1039
01:28:28,805 --> 01:28:30,015
What are you doing, bruh?

1040
01:28:30,515 --> 01:28:31,933
I'm hungry.

1041
01:28:32,017 --> 01:28:33,685
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, damn.

1042
01:28:33,768 --> 01:28:35,061
Surprise.

1043
01:28:38,773 --> 01:28:40,400
Nice clubhouse.

1044
01:28:51,828 --> 01:28:53,204
'Sup, man?

1045
01:28:58,209 --> 01:28:59,335
Nice to meet you.

1046
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:17,145
So you got
my postcard, huh?

1047
01:29:33,912 --> 01:29:37,040
Little B.
Yes, it's daddy.

1048
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:40,627
How you doin'?
Stayin' out of trouble?

1049
01:29:42,879 --> 01:29:45,090
Of course not.
Well, at least you're honest.

1050
01:29:45,173 --> 01:29:47,217
And that's the most
important thing.

1051
01:29:48,968 --> 01:29:51,763
Oh, I miss you
so much more.

1052
01:29:52,764 --> 01:29:54,516
And I'm coming home soon.

1053
01:29:55,642 --> 01:29:57,185
How's...

1054
01:29:57,268 --> 01:30:00,939
I'll tell you what, if I'm not home
by the time you count till 1,000,

1055
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:03,233
you tell Uncle Brian

1056
01:30:03,316 --> 01:30:06,027
that I said you could have
a second treat before dinner.

1057
01:30:09,823 --> 01:30:11,574
It's a promise.

1058
01:30:14,285 --> 01:30:16,204
And I always keep my promises.

1059
01:30:19,374 --> 01:30:21,417
I'm just still trying
to figure out...

1060
01:30:22,335 --> 01:30:23,920
How are you still alive?

1061
01:30:26,422 --> 01:30:28,341
Well, after
Gisele died...

1062
01:30:30,093 --> 01:30:31,678
...I didn't know what to do.

1063
01:30:33,221 --> 01:30:34,430
I was aimless.

1064
01:30:36,099 --> 01:30:37,767
- Lost.
- Absolutely.

1065
01:30:37,851 --> 01:30:39,394
But can you get
to the part where

1066
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:42,939
the car exploded
and you're still alive?

1067
01:30:43,022 --> 01:30:44,858
- Like, I'm trying to...
- Roman, can you...

1068
01:30:44,941 --> 01:30:46,734
Can you just be quiet
for one minute?

1069
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:48,653
We made plans.

1070
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:51,364
We had dreams.

1071
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:54,158
So what's our next
adventure after this?

1072
01:30:56,703 --> 01:30:59,998
How about we stay
in one place?

1073
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:02,500
Where are you thinking?

1074
01:31:02,709 --> 01:31:03,710
Tokyo.

1075
01:31:04,419 --> 01:31:06,212
We always talk
about Tokyo.

1076
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:08,006
Tokyo it is.

1077
01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:12,176
<i>You know, it's funny,
Gisele led me there,</i>

1078
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:14,971
and I wasn't even
looking for it.

1079
01:31:17,724 --> 01:31:19,058
But it became home.

1080
01:31:20,768 --> 01:31:22,937
Then, one day,
Mr. Nobody came calling.

1081
01:31:23,313 --> 01:31:25,148
<i>I worked with Gisele.</i>

1082
01:31:25,231 --> 01:31:27,400
Back when I was
a CIA operative

1083
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:30,194
running the drug trade
in Central America.

1084
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:32,989
The good old days.

1085
01:31:33,406 --> 01:31:35,033
Gisele was my best.

1086
01:31:35,867 --> 01:31:37,952
You can lose an asset
at any time.

1087
01:31:39,746 --> 01:31:42,415
Bullet, knife, wire.

1088
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:45,460
But I never thought
I'd lose her...

1089
01:31:46,336 --> 01:31:47,670
...to love.

1090
01:31:51,299 --> 01:31:52,300
What do you want?

1091
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:54,677
I'm offering you a job, Han.

1092
01:31:55,637 --> 01:31:57,513
Here, in Tokyo.

1093
01:31:58,264 --> 01:31:59,432
Why me?

1094
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:01,476
'Cause I saw your work
with Gisele.

1095
01:32:01,559 --> 01:32:03,853
I saw that
she trusted you.

1096
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:07,357
And that means
I can trust you.

1097
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:13,154
And that is very rare
in this line of work.

1098
01:32:19,077 --> 01:32:21,329
<i>And all I knew was that
I had to steal some tech</i>

1099
01:32:21,412 --> 01:32:23,289
<i>from the home
of a scientist couple.</i>

1100
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:29,003
<i>But, as usual,</i>

1101
01:32:30,088 --> 01:32:32,173
<i>Mr. Nobody didn't tell me
everything.</i>

1102
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:36,177
In fact, he left out
the most important part.

1103
01:32:41,307 --> 01:32:42,809
I was 11.

1104
01:32:43,893 --> 01:32:46,479
My parents would take me
to the movies on Saturdays

1105
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:48,398
if I tried hard in school
during the week.

1106
01:32:49,649 --> 01:32:51,859
<i>I was so excited to go</i>

1107
01:32:52,193 --> 01:32:55,571
<i>I forgot my raincoat,
so I went back in.</i>

1108
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:04,372
<i>At first, I didn't see it.</i>

1109
01:33:06,374 --> 01:33:08,543
By the time I looked out
the window...

1110
01:33:11,963 --> 01:33:13,673
...Mom and Dad were gone.

1111
01:33:13,756 --> 01:33:16,175
Turns out I wasn't
the only one looking for this thing.

1112
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:45,413
Get down!

1113
01:33:55,214 --> 01:33:56,591
<i>Han saved me.</i>

1114
01:33:57,508 --> 01:33:58,968
<i>Wouldn't leave me behind.</i>

1115
01:33:59,844 --> 01:34:01,387
He knew I'd always
be a target,

1116
01:34:01,471 --> 01:34:03,389
so he taught me
how to survive.

1117
01:34:06,392 --> 01:34:08,144
We became a family.

1118
01:34:10,897 --> 01:34:12,565
"Always be a target"?

1119
01:34:14,525 --> 01:34:15,693
Why?

1120
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:17,820
'Cause she is the key.

1121
01:34:22,575 --> 01:34:24,869
Everybody's been looking
for a thing.

1122
01:34:26,204 --> 01:34:27,789
It was a person all along.

1123
01:34:28,998 --> 01:34:32,460
My parents didn't want
Project Aries to fall into the wrong hands,

1124
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:35,797
so they locked it with their own DNA,
something we share.

1125
01:34:37,006 --> 01:34:40,009
And then, one day,
Mr. Nobody gave me the heads-up

1126
01:34:40,093 --> 01:34:41,969
that one of his best agents
went rogue.

1127
01:34:42,637 --> 01:34:44,806
So when Deckard Shaw
came calling,

1128
01:34:45,264 --> 01:34:46,474
<i>we used it as cover.</i>

1129
01:34:52,647 --> 01:34:55,399
But you got killed
in a car crash, Han.

1130
01:34:57,193 --> 01:34:59,737
Mr. Nobody had a way
of making things look real.

1131
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:09,455
Pretty nifty magic trick.

1132
01:35:10,414 --> 01:35:12,083
Yeah, I've done better.

1133
01:35:14,168 --> 01:35:15,878
Now for the hard part.

1134
01:35:18,381 --> 01:35:19,882
Keeping you dead.

1135
01:35:22,677 --> 01:35:23,886
My death...

1136
01:35:24,262 --> 01:35:26,097
...became the best way
to stay alive.

1137
01:35:31,727 --> 01:35:33,622
- What's happening?
- It's some kind of hidden subroutine

1138
01:35:33,646 --> 01:35:34,689
the system follows.

1139
01:35:58,546 --> 01:36:00,214
That's it, right there.

1140
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:02,341
Yeah, nobody moves,

1141
01:36:03,259 --> 01:36:04,969
everybody lives.

1142
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,185
Jakob.

1143
01:36:13,644 --> 01:36:14,770
I'm sorry, Mia.

1144
01:36:18,774 --> 01:36:20,276
I was the rogue agent.

1145
01:36:21,569 --> 01:36:22,653
Me.

1146
01:36:23,404 --> 01:36:25,823
Dom, you ever think about
how Mr. Nobody found you?

1147
01:36:25,907 --> 01:36:28,367
Think he just dropped out
of the sky and chose you?

1148
01:36:28,784 --> 01:36:32,371
I ran missions with Mr. Nobody
out of this place for years.

1149
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:38,002
I've been looking for that key
for a long time, Dom.

1150
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:40,838
And you just
handed her over.

1151
01:36:42,215 --> 01:36:43,466
I told you.

1152
01:36:44,842 --> 01:36:46,177
This is my world.

1153
01:36:47,178 --> 01:36:48,387
Got it.

1154
01:36:49,555 --> 01:36:51,224
Got a lot of guys here.

1155
01:36:51,933 --> 01:36:53,392
You trust 'em?

1156
01:36:53,893 --> 01:36:55,061
Trust this.

1157
01:37:00,524 --> 01:37:02,985
You know the only good thing
to come from Dad dying?

1158
01:37:05,988 --> 01:37:09,033
If he hadn't, I'd have spent
my entire life in your shadow.

1159
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:16,165
And now you're gonna
spend the rest of yours living in mine.

1160
01:37:19,919 --> 01:37:22,338
Only good thing
about Dad dying...

1161
01:37:23,422 --> 01:37:25,800
...was he didn't have to watch
what you became.

1162
01:37:26,717 --> 01:37:29,136
You never deserved
the Toretto name.

1163
01:37:31,806 --> 01:37:33,224
You think
you knew Dad, huh?

1164
01:37:33,307 --> 01:37:35,507
What, 'cause you were his favorite?
You don't know shit!

1165
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:37,561
Okay?

1166
01:37:38,271 --> 01:37:39,730
You want the truth?

1167
01:37:43,109 --> 01:37:45,486
Dad died 'cause he was
trying to throw that race.

1168
01:37:46,487 --> 01:37:48,197
We were in deep debt.

1169
01:37:48,906 --> 01:37:50,574
'Cause of how
he felt about you,

1170
01:37:51,659 --> 01:37:53,286
he had to ask me
for help.

1171
01:37:53,411 --> 01:37:56,080
How was I supposed to know
that car was gonna blow?

1172
01:37:57,290 --> 01:37:59,250
A good son would've said no.

1173
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:03,045
And a real brother
would've come to me.

1174
01:38:03,129 --> 01:38:04,422
Come to you?

1175
01:38:09,552 --> 01:38:11,971
He made me promise
you would never find out.

1176
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:14,974
And through all of it...

1177
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:18,311
...I kept that promise.

1178
01:38:25,943 --> 01:38:27,194
The girl comes
with me.

1179
01:38:27,695 --> 01:38:28,696
Jakob!

1180
01:38:31,949 --> 01:38:33,367
I will stop you.

1181
01:38:34,577 --> 01:38:35,953
And that's my promise.

1182
01:38:39,999 --> 01:38:41,292
Hey!

1183
01:38:46,339 --> 01:38:48,090
Sue. Sue. Ah.

1184
01:38:48,758 --> 01:38:50,092
Come on. Come on.

1185
01:39:18,162 --> 01:39:19,830
Down!

1186
01:39:30,216 --> 01:39:31,258
Go! Go!

1187
01:39:31,342 --> 01:39:32,385
Come on!

1188
01:39:42,978 --> 01:39:44,105
This way!

1189
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:06,210
I'm always here.

1190
01:40:06,752 --> 01:40:07,837
Tell him.

1191
01:40:09,755 --> 01:40:11,674
No!

1192
01:40:13,217 --> 01:40:14,969
No!

1193
01:41:29,376 --> 01:41:31,295
No!

1194
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:51,148
<i>Dom.</i>

1195
01:41:51,273 --> 01:41:53,317
<i>Tell me what you see, son.</i>

1196
01:42:01,075 --> 01:42:03,285
See, cars like this
are immortal.

1197
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:11,752
'70 Chargers
are designed so well

1198
01:42:12,127 --> 01:42:13,671
that if you take care
of 'em,

1199
01:42:14,046 --> 01:42:15,839
they'll run for 100 years.

1200
01:42:16,465 --> 01:42:17,841
Immortal?

1201
01:42:21,011 --> 01:42:22,179
Just like a family, Dom.

1202
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:26,225
Build it right,
you take care of it...

1203
01:42:28,143 --> 01:42:29,520
...it'll live beyond you.

1204
01:42:29,937 --> 01:42:31,146
Daddy.

1205
01:42:39,655 --> 01:42:40,739
Little B.

1206
01:42:41,574 --> 01:42:43,117
When are you coming home?

1207
01:42:43,867 --> 01:42:44,868
Come...

1208
01:43:02,928 --> 01:43:06,557
No. You know I'm good for it.
I promise I'll deliver.

1209
01:43:49,141 --> 01:43:50,410
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

1210
01:43:50,434 --> 01:43:52,061
- Last two laps.
- On it!

1211
01:43:52,144 --> 01:43:53,687
Get those plug wires!

1212
01:43:55,481 --> 01:43:57,358
Jakob! Now.

1213
01:44:23,425 --> 01:44:24,505
You're good!

1214
01:44:41,985 --> 01:44:44,113
No!

1215
01:45:29,825 --> 01:45:31,493
You came for me, Letty.

1216
01:45:32,286 --> 01:45:36,331
None of it is worth a thing
if I lose you.

1217
01:45:37,082 --> 01:45:38,542
Do you hear me?

1218
01:45:41,336 --> 01:45:42,963
Is this who we are?

1219
01:45:48,802 --> 01:45:49,803
Yeah.

1220
01:45:54,933 --> 01:45:56,643
From here,
things move quickly.

1221
01:45:56,727 --> 01:45:58,353
Jakob has all the pieces
he needs.

1222
01:45:58,437 --> 01:45:59,646
Once he activates Aries,

1223
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:01,458
all he needs to do
is send the signal global.

1224
01:46:01,482 --> 01:46:03,567
And then there's
no stopping him, ever.

1225
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:06,028
He'll have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite,

1226
01:46:06,111 --> 01:46:07,946
something that'll act
as an amplifier,

1227
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:10,449
infecting other satellites
in orbit one by one.

1228
01:46:10,532 --> 01:46:13,118
So we find him, stop him,
and then we get Elle back.

1229
01:46:13,202 --> 01:46:14,661
Our odds are
zero here, Han.

1230
01:46:14,953 --> 01:46:16,830
Satellite equipment
is easy enough to track,

1231
01:46:16,914 --> 01:46:18,594
but we're not gonna
beat Jakob to a launch.

1232
01:46:18,624 --> 01:46:20,344
Which gives us
a two-target problem:

1233
01:46:21,001 --> 01:46:22,127
Jakob on the ground...

1234
01:46:22,211 --> 01:46:23,629
With his own private army.

1235
01:46:23,754 --> 01:46:25,798
- And the satellite.
- Which can't be hacked.

1236
01:46:25,881 --> 01:46:26,882
Not remotely.

1237
01:46:26,965 --> 01:46:28,067
We'd have to do it
physically,

1238
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:31,094
Fifty miles above ground
while the satellite is in orbit.

1239
01:46:31,595 --> 01:46:32,721
Orbit?

1240
01:46:33,013 --> 01:46:34,181
We need help.

1241
01:46:34,306 --> 01:46:36,099
Otherwise, we have no chance.

1242
01:46:37,309 --> 01:46:38,560
We do it ourselves.

1243
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:42,147
It's where we've been
that got us this far.

1244
01:46:42,564 --> 01:46:44,441
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1245
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,443
Do y'all not understand?

1246
01:46:47,194 --> 01:46:48,570
Clearly, y'all don't.

1247
01:46:48,695 --> 01:46:51,865
Because if you did,
you'd be pissing your pants

1248
01:46:51,949 --> 01:46:53,033
like a normal person.

1249
01:46:53,367 --> 01:46:54,368
Orbit.

1250
01:46:54,701 --> 01:46:55,953
That's outer space.

1251
01:46:56,453 --> 01:46:57,996
That's another level.

1252
01:46:58,205 --> 01:47:01,041
What we gonna do?
Hijack a space shuttle?

1253
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:03,043
Put rockets on our backs?

1254
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:06,630
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

1255
01:47:07,422 --> 01:47:08,423
What?

1256
01:47:23,188 --> 01:47:25,983
There goes my father's diplomatic ties
with Eastern Europe.

1257
01:47:26,066 --> 01:47:28,986
This place is going to be crawling
with every cop in the city.

1258
01:47:29,653 --> 01:47:31,488
Time to get the hell
out of here.

1259
01:47:52,593 --> 01:47:53,677
Keep her close.

1260
01:48:04,521 --> 01:48:05,939
It's activated.

1261
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:12,529
As soon as the satellite reaches orbit,
we start the uplink.

1262
01:48:16,033 --> 01:48:17,826
Oh, damn.

1263
01:48:18,619 --> 01:48:19,870
What?

1264
01:48:20,746 --> 01:48:22,080
You see that?

1265
01:48:22,664 --> 01:48:24,583
We can't have
an air leak, man.

1266
01:48:27,878 --> 01:48:30,839
Are you really patching
yourself up with duct tape?

1267
01:48:30,923 --> 01:48:31,965
Yes.

1268
01:48:32,049 --> 01:48:33,318
I don't know
if you've noticed or not,

1269
01:48:33,342 --> 01:48:35,844
but this whole operation
is Band-Aids and duct tape.

1270
01:48:35,928 --> 01:48:37,804
Man, this is insane.

1271
01:48:37,888 --> 01:48:39,806
We are headed
to outer space.

1272
01:48:40,182 --> 01:48:42,726
You acting like we on our way
to Home Depot.

1273
01:48:42,851 --> 01:48:44,311
This is ridiculous, man.

1274
01:48:44,394 --> 01:48:47,648
I'm about to abort this whole mission
and take my Black ass home.

1275
01:48:47,731 --> 01:48:50,859
We're literally gonna be
in a perpetual freefall.

1276
01:48:50,943 --> 01:48:52,069
Freefall?

1277
01:48:52,152 --> 01:48:53,445
What does that
even mean?

1278
01:48:53,528 --> 01:48:56,031
Roman, it means
numbers don't lie.

1279
01:48:56,323 --> 01:48:58,659
As long as we obey
the laws of physics,

1280
01:48:58,742 --> 01:49:00,661
then we'll be fine, okay?

1281
01:49:00,911 --> 01:49:02,829
It's just all
math and science.

1282
01:49:02,913 --> 01:49:05,332
I knew I should've
listened to my teachers.

1283
01:49:05,415 --> 01:49:06,750
Four minutes to launch.

1284
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:08,001
You fellas good to go?

1285
01:49:09,294 --> 01:49:12,631
Yeah, we just up here
putting a bunch of duct tape on shit.

1286
01:49:12,714 --> 01:49:14,257
You know,
that's what Tej do.

1287
01:49:14,341 --> 01:49:17,177
Man, please hurry up
so I can stop hearing his damn mouth.

1288
01:49:17,260 --> 01:49:19,554
- Yes, we're good to go.
- We're not good.

1289
01:49:19,638 --> 01:49:20,847
This is the same car

1290
01:49:20,931 --> 01:49:22,057
that we watched

1291
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:24,101
do a test run and explode.

1292
01:49:24,184 --> 01:49:25,477
This is not smart, Tej.

1293
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:26,561
<i>Don't worry, man.</i>

1294
01:49:26,645 --> 01:49:29,231
With my ceramic polymer coating,
you're gonna be just fine.

1295
01:49:29,314 --> 01:49:31,191
You're 100% fireproof.

1296
01:49:32,567 --> 01:49:33,819
Exactly.

1297
01:49:33,902 --> 01:49:35,362
<i>All eight thrusters</i>

1298
01:49:35,445 --> 01:49:36,655
fully functional.

1299
01:49:39,992 --> 01:49:43,120
Hey, please don't tell me
you're still running launch simulations.

1300
01:49:43,245 --> 01:49:45,539
Virgin Galactic launched
at 36,000 feet.

1301
01:49:45,664 --> 01:49:47,874
The space shuttle tests
around 50,000 feet.

1302
01:49:47,958 --> 01:49:50,269
Our last test run with this load means
we'll have to go higher,

1303
01:49:50,293 --> 01:49:51,294
way higher!

1304
01:49:51,378 --> 01:49:52,658
If we don't get them
high enough,

1305
01:49:52,754 --> 01:49:55,007
these guys are
gonna be pancakes at IHOP

1306
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:56,651
before the coffee
even gets to the table.

1307
01:49:56,675 --> 01:49:58,719
Hey! We can still hear you!

1308
01:49:58,802 --> 01:50:00,887
Don't worry, guys.
We got this.

1309
01:50:01,722 --> 01:50:02,889
We do got this, right?

1310
01:50:32,919 --> 01:50:35,338
I've run thermal imaging.
Elle's in the armory truck.

1311
01:50:35,672 --> 01:50:36,899
And I've got a lock
on the Aries signal.

1312
01:50:36,923 --> 01:50:38,317
It's coming from
the beast up ahead.

1313
01:50:38,341 --> 01:50:40,135
We need to get in there
to deactivate it

1314
01:50:40,218 --> 01:50:41,928
by the time Roman
and Tej are in position.

1315
01:50:42,012 --> 01:50:44,097
Ramsey, power us up.

1316
01:50:47,184 --> 01:50:49,102
Satellite is in low orbit.

1317
01:50:51,521 --> 01:50:52,564
Begin.

1318
01:51:08,538 --> 01:51:10,582
All right,
we're passing 50,000 feet!

1319
01:51:10,874 --> 01:51:12,626
Time to get ready, boys.

1320
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:14,294
What we supposed
to be doing

1321
01:51:14,377 --> 01:51:16,588
with these old-ass suits

1322
01:51:16,671 --> 01:51:18,715
that ain't been used
since World War I?

1323
01:51:18,799 --> 01:51:19,966
Oh, I'm sorry.

1324
01:51:20,175 --> 01:51:23,303
Astronauts R Us
was closed for shopping today.

1325
01:51:23,553 --> 01:51:26,014
Listen, these suits
are just like space suits.

1326
01:51:26,098 --> 01:51:28,016
They both account
for pressure differential.

1327
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:31,103
Only thing is we may
blow up like balloons just a little bit.

1328
01:51:31,186 --> 01:51:32,729
- That's the only difference.
- What?

1329
01:51:32,813 --> 01:51:34,356
We just hit
the launch altitude.

1330
01:51:34,481 --> 01:51:36,817
- You guys ready for a five count?
<i>- No, man!</i>

1331
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:40,278
I'm barely ready to go scuba diving
in this old-ass thing.

1332
01:51:40,362 --> 01:51:41,822
Don't listen to him.
We ready!

1333
01:51:41,905 --> 01:51:43,240
- "We"?
- Yes, I said "we"!

1334
01:51:43,323 --> 01:51:44,866
I thought you
was invincible.

1335
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:47,619
Let's see how invincible
your Black ass is after this.

1336
01:51:47,702 --> 01:51:49,079
- Punch it!
- No! Tej!

1337
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:55,085
Oh, my God!
I don't want to die!

1338
01:51:55,418 --> 01:51:56,837
Ignition!

1339
01:52:41,173 --> 01:52:43,800
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1340
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:49,681
We're in outer space!

1341
01:52:50,974 --> 01:52:52,809
Told you numbers don't lie.

1342
01:52:53,685 --> 01:52:55,770
This is crazy, bro!

1343
01:53:07,073 --> 01:53:09,367
Man, how much candy
did you eat?

1344
01:53:09,451 --> 01:53:12,037
Well, I... I eat candy
when I get nervous.

1345
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:14,998
If you shart in this Fiero,
I swear to...

1346
01:53:15,081 --> 01:53:17,626
Really? Really, Tej?

1347
01:53:26,718 --> 01:53:28,678
I thought you said
you took care of this.

1348
01:53:30,263 --> 01:53:31,806
Yeah. Hey.

1349
01:53:32,307 --> 01:53:35,310
You take them back
to the freaking junkyard right now!

1350
01:55:10,947 --> 01:55:12,782
All right, Han, Mia,
you're up!

1351
01:55:26,755 --> 01:55:27,756
Now.

1352
01:55:33,595 --> 01:55:34,763
Letty.

1353
01:55:54,908 --> 01:55:56,242
Han!

1354
01:56:54,217 --> 01:56:55,468
Not all of us.

1355
01:57:09,816 --> 01:57:12,444
Now, the satellite we looking
for should be somewhere...

1356
01:57:13,153 --> 01:57:14,362
There.

1357
01:57:14,446 --> 01:57:15,822
Right there.
You see it?

1358
01:57:16,197 --> 01:57:17,198
Got it.

1359
01:57:17,282 --> 01:57:19,451
Tell me you know
how to work the thrusters.

1360
01:57:19,534 --> 01:57:22,495
Tej, numbers is
what you do, right?

1361
01:57:23,997 --> 01:57:25,707
Driving is what I do.

1362
01:57:32,839 --> 01:57:36,134
Two dudes from the ghetto,
outer space.

1363
01:57:38,219 --> 01:57:40,221
You know ain't nobody
gonna believe us, right?

1364
01:57:41,181 --> 01:57:42,307
You're right.

1365
01:57:50,815 --> 01:57:52,650
Something's wrong
with the satellite array.

1366
01:57:52,734 --> 01:57:54,986
It's interfering
with the uplink.

1367
01:57:57,614 --> 01:57:58,948
I'll handle it.

1368
01:58:17,634 --> 01:58:18,635
Han?

1369
01:58:20,094 --> 01:58:21,304
Grab the wheel.

1370
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:22,931
Something's up.

1371
01:58:24,766 --> 01:58:26,476
I think I can link
into their feed.

1372
01:58:40,198 --> 01:58:41,598
Something you want
to tell me, Otto?

1373
01:58:41,658 --> 01:58:44,369
My bad. Satellite uplink
is actually going splendid.

1374
01:58:44,869 --> 01:58:47,288
Oh, and, by the way,
I have a new business partner.

1375
01:58:47,372 --> 01:58:48,373
Maybe you know her.

1376
01:58:48,456 --> 01:58:50,750
Guess who's out
of the box, Jakob.

1377
01:58:52,377 --> 01:58:54,170
But I did try to warn you.

1378
01:58:56,923 --> 01:58:58,758
You were never my competition.

1379
01:58:59,384 --> 01:59:00,969
Otto, there's something
you should know.

1380
01:59:01,052 --> 01:59:02,762
Yeah, go on.
Lay it on me, dude.

1381
01:59:02,845 --> 01:59:04,013
You're a spoiled rich prick,

1382
01:59:04,097 --> 01:59:05,265
<i>and I'm gonna kill you.</i>

1383
01:59:05,348 --> 01:59:06,766
Oh, man, I am so sorry.

1384
01:59:06,849 --> 01:59:08,268
No one told you, huh?

1385
01:59:08,726 --> 01:59:12,397
Spoiled rich pricks
run the world.

1386
02:00:37,899 --> 02:00:39,317
Come on. Come on!

1387
02:00:57,835 --> 02:00:58,878
Go.

1388
02:01:38,376 --> 02:01:40,253
What's happening?

1389
02:01:40,336 --> 02:01:43,798
Well, we appear to have lost
our escort and Jakob.

1390
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:46,759
And, well, Dom is making things
a little bit difficult here,

1391
02:01:46,843 --> 02:01:48,195
but it's fine.
Really, it's peachy.

1392
02:01:48,219 --> 02:01:49,220
<i>Don't worry,
don't worry.</i>

1393
02:01:49,303 --> 02:01:50,722
I'll finish this myself.

1394
02:01:55,184 --> 02:01:57,603
All right, let's see
what that beast is made of.

1395
02:01:58,354 --> 02:01:59,397
You ready, Elle?

1396
02:02:12,827 --> 02:02:14,203
Crank it.

1397
02:02:14,287 --> 02:02:16,122
If we can't break through,
we stop it.

1398
02:02:47,445 --> 02:02:49,197
Guys, that thing
is not slowing down

1399
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,990
<i>and the download's
almost done.</i>

1400
02:02:51,115 --> 02:02:53,826
<i>Dom, we don't get out of here now,
we're dead.</i>

1401
02:03:03,753 --> 02:03:06,255
Letty, drop back and line up
with the front tires.

1402
02:03:06,339 --> 02:03:07,340
What?

1403
02:03:07,423 --> 02:03:09,509
<i>If we can't slow it
and we can't punch through,</i>

1404
02:03:09,592 --> 02:03:11,302
we flip it and we hit
the underside.

1405
02:03:11,385 --> 02:03:14,055
Goddamn it!
Why do I have to say this?

1406
02:03:14,138 --> 02:03:15,598
Flatten these clowns!

1407
02:03:34,408 --> 02:03:35,409
Letty, the wires.

1408
02:03:35,493 --> 02:03:36,494
You read my mind.

1409
02:03:36,577 --> 02:03:37,662
Han, get in front of me.

1410
02:03:39,789 --> 02:03:41,582
Dom, I can't get to you.

1411
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:44,168
<i>But I can.</i>

1412
02:04:59,744 --> 02:05:01,787
All right, the satellite
is in range.

1413
02:05:01,913 --> 02:05:03,831
Let's power up these magnets
and fry it.

1414
02:05:04,248 --> 02:05:05,583
All right, take our time.

1415
02:05:15,843 --> 02:05:17,303
Okay. All right.

1416
02:05:18,971 --> 02:05:19,972
Tej!

1417
02:05:20,056 --> 02:05:21,682
Hold on. Come on, baby.

1418
02:05:21,766 --> 02:05:23,726
Power up. Power up.

1419
02:05:26,228 --> 02:05:27,313
Shit.

1420
02:05:27,396 --> 02:05:28,773
Shit, shit, shit.

1421
02:05:28,856 --> 02:05:31,400
What? Talk to me.
What's going on?

1422
02:05:31,484 --> 02:05:33,754
The pressure of the launch,
it must have jammed the cables

1423
02:05:33,778 --> 02:05:35,196
to the power source.

1424
02:05:35,988 --> 02:05:38,032
Damn it, how did
I not think of that?

1425
02:05:38,741 --> 02:05:40,493
<i>Guys, where are you?</i>

1426
02:05:40,576 --> 02:05:43,037
<i>The upload is almost complete.</i>

1427
02:05:44,497 --> 02:05:46,540
Why don't you just kill it?

1428
02:05:46,832 --> 02:05:48,918
Let's smash it.
Let's run it over, right?

1429
02:05:49,001 --> 02:05:52,380
No. If we crash into that satellite,
we'll probably die.

1430
02:05:52,463 --> 02:05:55,383
And even if we don't,
the fuel that it would take to smash it,

1431
02:05:56,008 --> 02:05:57,593
we'd be stuck
out here forever.

1432
02:05:58,844 --> 02:06:00,346
You got to have faith, bro.

1433
02:06:00,429 --> 02:06:02,890
Faith? Faith is not numbers.

1434
02:06:03,224 --> 02:06:04,725
You know what, Tej?

1435
02:06:06,227 --> 02:06:07,561
You're probably right.

1436
02:06:10,523 --> 02:06:11,732
<i>We're not invincible.</i>

1437
02:06:14,902 --> 02:06:18,155
<i>We probablyjust been
lucky this whole time.</i>

1438
02:06:23,911 --> 02:06:25,413
<i>This might be it.</i>

1439
02:06:28,332 --> 02:06:29,667
<i>But you know what?</i>

1440
02:06:31,293 --> 02:06:32,670
<i>If we're gonna go out...</i>

1441
02:06:34,588 --> 02:06:36,507
...let's go out
on top of the world.

1442
02:06:37,883 --> 02:06:39,885
<i>Guys,
what's happening up there?</i>

1443
02:06:39,969 --> 02:06:41,637
We've got seconds left.

1444
02:06:44,557 --> 02:06:45,641
Let's do it.

1445
02:06:46,225 --> 02:06:47,268
Let's go.

1446
02:06:51,647 --> 02:06:54,859
Five, four, three,

1447
02:06:54,942 --> 02:06:56,652
two, one.

1448
02:07:15,796 --> 02:07:16,922
We did it.

1449
02:07:18,174 --> 02:07:19,383
We did it!

1450
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:20,551
Let's go.

1451
02:07:20,634 --> 02:07:21,886
Yes!

1452
02:07:22,553 --> 02:07:23,596
Shit.

1453
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:25,139
Not bad, man.

1454
02:07:25,723 --> 02:07:26,723
Not bad at all.

1455
02:07:52,333 --> 02:07:53,626
Hold on!

1456
02:08:02,426 --> 02:08:03,594
Dom!

1457
02:09:00,025 --> 02:09:01,026
Yes!

1458
02:09:07,616 --> 02:09:09,118
Got to be kidding me.

1459
02:09:45,237 --> 02:09:46,238
Shit!

1460
02:10:38,457 --> 02:10:40,334
Think these
belong to you.

1461
02:10:50,386 --> 02:10:53,013
There's gonna be a lot of people
coming after you, Jake.

1462
02:10:53,514 --> 02:10:54,723
Yeah.

1463
02:10:55,724 --> 02:10:56,976
This is the world
I chose, Dom.

1464
02:10:58,894 --> 02:11:00,813
You know,
Dad wasn't perfect.

1465
02:11:02,439 --> 02:11:04,358
But he loved us
all the same.

1466
02:11:08,112 --> 02:11:10,906
Someone once gave me
a ten-second car,

1467
02:11:12,157 --> 02:11:13,492
as a second chance.

1468
02:11:15,369 --> 02:11:17,454
I owe you that,
little brother.

1469
02:11:30,926 --> 02:11:32,386
I lost you once.

1470
02:11:33,721 --> 02:11:35,347
Don't let that
happen again, okay?

1471
02:12:17,139 --> 02:12:18,766
We come in peace!

1472
02:12:19,433 --> 02:12:20,642
Hey!

1473
02:12:49,046 --> 02:12:51,590
This was the last place
I saw your grandfather.

1474
02:12:53,884 --> 02:12:55,135
This is where he raced.

1475
02:12:55,677 --> 02:12:57,638
Did you race here, too, Daddy?

1476
02:12:57,971 --> 02:12:59,056
No.

1477
02:12:59,473 --> 02:13:01,058
But I'll tell you something.

1478
02:13:03,310 --> 02:13:06,897
Everything I needed to know about life,
I learned on this track.

1479
02:13:07,189 --> 02:13:08,190
You did?

1480
02:13:09,191 --> 02:13:10,275
I did.

1481
02:13:53,902 --> 02:13:55,821
It's all gonna
be okay, Jakob.

1482
02:13:59,908 --> 02:14:01,952
We got some
rough times ahead...

1483
02:14:04,413 --> 02:14:06,290
...but it's gonna be okay.

1484
02:14:08,667 --> 02:14:10,085
'Cause we're family.

1485
02:14:35,611 --> 02:14:37,362
- Fellas.
- Hey.

1486
02:14:44,161 --> 02:14:45,162
What?

1487
02:14:45,829 --> 02:14:47,247
No way.

1488
02:14:57,507 --> 02:14:59,718
What's going on?

1489
02:15:02,221 --> 02:15:04,598
I couldn't believe it
when I heard you were alive.

1490
02:15:09,228 --> 02:15:10,646
It's a long story.

1491
02:15:11,772 --> 02:15:14,024
But, for now,
let's just enjoy the moment, huh?

1492
02:15:15,192 --> 02:15:16,318
Guys, this is Elle.

1493
02:15:16,526 --> 02:15:18,320
Hey, Elle. I'm Sean.

1494
02:15:19,738 --> 02:15:20,739
Just call me T.

1495
02:15:20,822 --> 02:15:22,262
- I'm Earl.
- Nice to meet you.

1496
02:15:23,951 --> 02:15:25,035
Mia.

1497
02:15:28,872 --> 02:15:30,624
Hi. Nice to finally
meet you.

1498
02:15:39,883 --> 02:15:41,593
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1499
02:15:42,469 --> 02:15:44,304
How much longer
on this food?

1500
02:15:44,721 --> 02:15:46,974
Like, I'm...
I'm ready to eat now.

1501
02:15:47,266 --> 02:15:49,726
I've been eating
space food for weeks.

1502
02:15:50,018 --> 02:15:52,854
Oh, so Tootsie Rolls
are space food?

1503
02:15:53,188 --> 02:15:54,273
'Cause that's all
you ate.

1504
02:15:54,523 --> 02:15:56,024
It was fat free, bruh.

1505
02:15:56,108 --> 02:15:57,651
Snickers and Twix
fat free, too?

1506
02:15:57,734 --> 02:15:58,902
I'm forehead hungry.

1507
02:15:58,986 --> 02:16:00,088
Yeah, okay.
I'll see you later.

1508
02:16:00,112 --> 02:16:01,392
Your forehead
is overweight.

1509
02:16:04,574 --> 02:16:06,451
You drive just
like your dad.

1510
02:16:07,494 --> 02:16:08,495
I do?

1511
02:16:08,578 --> 02:16:09,663
Mm-hmm.

1512
02:16:10,664 --> 02:16:12,291
Do you know, this is...

1513
02:16:13,041 --> 02:16:15,460
This is where I met your mom
for the first time.

1514
02:16:15,794 --> 02:16:16,837
Right there.

1515
02:16:17,087 --> 02:16:18,880
She's watching over you
from heaven.

1516
02:16:19,172 --> 02:16:20,173
She is?

1517
02:16:20,257 --> 02:16:21,341
Mm-hmm.

1518
02:16:24,219 --> 02:16:26,346
I think Daddy
has a question for you.

1519
02:16:30,892 --> 02:16:32,769
You ready to say grace, kid?

1520
02:16:33,395 --> 02:16:35,188
But I don't know what to say.

1521
02:16:36,398 --> 02:16:37,607
Oh, it's easy.

1522
02:16:38,525 --> 02:16:40,527
Just say whatever is
in your heart.

1523
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:42,738
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1524
02:16:42,821 --> 02:16:43,905
Come on.

1525
02:16:50,162 --> 02:16:51,204
Hey, guys.

1526
02:16:51,330 --> 02:16:52,706
Hey.

1527
02:16:53,665 --> 02:16:56,126
Little Brian's ready
to say grace with us.

1528
02:16:56,251 --> 02:16:57,669
- Uh-huh.
- Nice.

1529
02:16:58,211 --> 02:16:59,588
Now, hold on.

1530
02:17:00,756 --> 02:17:02,299
There's still an empty chair.

1531
02:17:03,258 --> 02:17:04,259
He's on the way.

1532
02:17:27,824 --> 02:17:29,284
<i>Get rich</i>

1533
02:17:32,496 --> 02:17:36,625
<i>Yeah, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay</i>

1534
02:17:36,917 --> 02:17:39,503
<i>Moving how I'm speeding
through the fast lane</i>

1535
02:17:39,628 --> 02:17:42,464
<i>They say I know magic
how my whips change</i>

1536
02:17:42,589 --> 02:17:45,050
<i>They don't see what I see</i>

1537
02:17:45,133 --> 02:17:47,511
<i>Go against the game,
you know it's pass me</i>

1538
02:17:47,594 --> 02:17:50,347
<i>Zero to hundred,
you know I'm on-on go</i>

1539
02:17:50,430 --> 02:17:53,141
<i>Play with my dogs,
you know I'm on-on go</i>

1540
02:17:53,225 --> 02:17:55,685
<i>Bottles on bottles,
you know I'm on-on go</i>

1541
02:17:55,769 --> 02:17:58,480
<i>Moving too fast,
you know we on-on go</i>

1542
02:17:58,563 --> 02:18:00,774
<i>I hit the switch and make
the wheels go up</i>

1543
02:18:00,899 --> 02:18:02,192
<i>If I got to make the call</i>

1544
02:18:02,317 --> 02:18:03,902
<i>You made
the wrong-wrong choice</i>

1545
02:18:03,985 --> 02:18:06,571
<i>I roll it up,
you know I'm on-on go</i>

1546
02:18:06,655 --> 02:18:09,282
<i>Moving too fast,
you know I'm on-on go</i>

1547
02:18:09,408 --> 02:18:11,827
<i>Fast lane, bet I push
a hundred in two seconds</i>

1548
02:18:11,952 --> 02:18:14,788
<i>I just spent a Bentley
and a Lambo on two necklaces</i>

1549
02:18:15,122 --> 02:18:17,249
<i>Take 'em on a high speed,
I'm too reckless</i>

1550
02:18:17,374 --> 02:18:20,085
<i>Demon time when I'm in that
Demon, they can't catch it</i>

1551
02:18:20,168 --> 02:18:22,629
<i>Bet they get the message,
I'm the best of the bestest</i>

1552
02:18:22,712 --> 02:18:25,173
<i>And I'm still waiting
for a bitch to check it</i>

1553
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:28,135
<i>Who want the smoke?
Better hope you don't choke</i>

1554
02:18:28,218 --> 02:18:30,762
<i>I be riding two-seater,
itjust me and the scope</i>

1555
02:18:31,138 --> 02:18:33,723
<i>I like my gangster
with a mouth full of golds, uh</i>

1556
02:18:33,807 --> 02:18:35,684
<i>He hit the lotto, that's goals</i>

1557
02:18:36,309 --> 02:18:38,895
<i>Moving how I'm speeding
through the fast lane</i>

1558
02:18:38,979 --> 02:18:41,690
<i>They say I know magic

02:18:57,956 --> 02:19:00,584
<i>High speed, the cars and me,
you know mine cost ten of 'em</i>

1566
02:19:00,667 --> 02:19:03,170
<i>All the scammers calling me
with cars, I need ten of them</i>

1567
02:19:03,253 --> 02:19:04,921
<i>Have these... flexing
with these cars</i>

1568
02:19:05,005 --> 02:19:06,047
<i>Knowing they rented them</i>

1569
02:19:06,131 --> 02:19:07,632
<i>I could put some rappers

<i>But ain't gon' mention them</i>

1571

02:20:04,189 --> 02:20:05,440
Thank you.

1577
02:20:05,524 --> 02:20:06,691
Please.

1578
02:20:06,816 --> 02:20:09,569
I tell you where the drive is,
the plans we stole.

1579
02:20:09,653 --> 02:20:10,904
I tell you
where it is.

1580
02:20:10,987 --> 02:20:11,988
You mean this drive?

1581
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:14,407
These plans?

1582
02:20:16,451 --> 02:20:18,203
But you already got it.

1583
02:20:18,286 --> 02:20:19,538
Yes, mate.

1584
02:20:20,163 --> 02:20:22,415
How else do you think
I stay in this good a shape?

1585
02:20:28,213 --> 02:20:29,798
Don't go anywhere.

1586
02:20:47,941 --> 02:20:49,568
<i>I'm a lane switcher</i>
