<i>I got a feeling
this is going to be a riot</i>

2
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,660
<i>I don't read
the news papers</i>

3
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,134

00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,532

00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,214
<i>Bring it on</i>

<i>At the starting

00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,117
<i>At summit talks
you'll hear them speak</i>

9
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,626
<i>It's only Monday</i>

10
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,490
<i>Negotiations breaking down</i>

11

<i>See those leaders
start to frown</i>

12
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,394
<i>It's sword and gun day</i>

13

<i>Tomorrow never comes

14
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,114
<i>You could be sitting

15
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,689
<i>The news will hit you
like a punch</i>

16
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,749
<i>It's only Tuesday</i>

17
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,658
<i>What time is it?</i>

18
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,359
<i>You never thought
we'd go to war</i>

19
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,866
<i>After all the things

<i>Tomorrow never comes

<i>Tomorrow never comes

24
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,512
<i>You hear
a whistling overhead</i>

25

<i>Are you alive

00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,302

<i>Tomorrow is another day</i>

41
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,318
Nice ride.

42
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,956
It does the job.

43
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,852
What job,
delivering pizzas?

44
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,259
Well, it's not the ride,
it's the rider.

45
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,069
What the hell
was that?

46
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,196
What?

47
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,806
Hey!
You talking to my girl?

48
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,137
Oh, shit. Here we go.
Yeah.

49
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,237
She was just
admiring my ride.

50
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,539
"My ride. "

51
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,207
My grandma's Buick
could smoke

52
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,217
that piece of shit,
trailer trash.

53
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,014
Well, what about
your daddy's Viper?

54
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,889
This beast's
got 500 horsepower

55
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,084
and a Borla exhaust system.

56
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,024
It does 0 to 60
in like 4.3 seconds...

57
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,062
That's about right.
That's about right. Yeah.

58
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,461
Wow.
You can read the brochure.

59
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,755
What a pitch, baby.
What a pitch. I like that.

60
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,916
What's he gonna do?

61
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,928
Let's make it happen.
Bring it.

62
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,870
I got your...
I got your back.

63
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,439
Why don't you nice boys
let your cars do the talking?

64
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,441
I only race
for pink slips.

65
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,248
This car goes for 80 grand.

66
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,414
What would I do with a broken-ass
piece of shit like that?

67
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,384
How about me?

68
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,495
Winner gets me.

69
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,340
Cut it, let's cut it.
Let's go, go, go, go!

70
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,958
Blast-off, baby!

71
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,724
First one out
the other side...

72
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,926
It's time.
Let's go!

73
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,404
Ready, boys? Make it interesting, Clay.

74
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,576
Shit!

75
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,256
Yeah!

76
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,861
I thought
you loved me.

77
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,372
Oh, well.

78
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,612
What the hell?

79
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,799
Guess I got
a new date for prom.

80
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,874
Clay, stop the car!
Shut up!

81
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,846
Clay, stop the car!

82
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:46,949
Shut up!

83
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,254
Stop it!

84
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,893
Clay, please stop!
Please stop!

85
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,063
Can I get
a copy of that?

86
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,372
You think
this is a joke, huh?

87
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,642
You see Ken and Barbie
over there?

88
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,582
They're gonna walk out of here
without even a slap on the wrist.

89
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,085
Mommy and Daddy
are too hooked up.

90
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,119
But I like
screw-ups like you.

91
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,625
You know why?

92
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,491
'Cause you're 100%
guaranteed conviction.

93
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,593
Where's my car?
I crushed it.

94
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,791
You did what?

95
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,026
Sit down! You're done.
Easy, easy.

96
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,500
You're done. You
understand me? You're done.

97
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,402
And all before your eighteenth
birthday. Now sit down.

98
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,767
Sean.

99
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,374
What the hell were
you thinkin', huh?

100
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,306
Mrs. Boswell? Please.

101
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,648
It's, uh, it's Miss.

102
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,653
Officer, is it, um,
illegal to smoke in here?

103
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,292
It's a tough state.

104
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,528
And it's
a pretty clear-cut case.

105
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,401
He'll be lucky if they don't
try him as an adult.

106
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,278
This is our third town
in two years.

107
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,473
Your son's got two priors
for reckless driving,

108
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,540
willful destruction
of property.

109
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,586
This makes it
strike three.

110
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,281
They're definitely gonna want
to get him off the streets.

111
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,189
Well, there's
just got to be another way.

112
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,435
So, where are we
moving this time?

113
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,099
We are not
moving anywhere.

114
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,415
Sean.

115
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,349
I thought you were
gonna be here on the 7th.

116
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,054
Today is the 7th.

117
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,988
Well, look,
just hold on one second.

118
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,691
Come on in.

119
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,097
This is it.

120
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,835
You know, Sean, I was,
I was gonna be there.

121
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,969
But your mom,
she said the 7th, see,

122
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,674
and we're a day
ahead of you in Japan.

123
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,881
Well, you're here now,
and that's good.

124
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,583
So, how is your mom?

125
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,254
Where do I sleep?

126
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,292
Now, Sean, you know
she had no other choice.

127
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,095
I mean, it was
either this or juvie hall,

128
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,933
I mean, you just
can't keep moving away

129
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,972
every time
you get into trouble.

130
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,963
Worked for you.

131
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,776
Look, neither of us
asked for this.

132
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,316
But I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

133
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,777
So you just go by the
rules her and I agreed to,

134
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,788
and I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

135
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,417
Rules?

136
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,085
Yeah, rules. Real simple.

137
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,094
You go to school,

138
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,823
you come back here
right after.

139
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,758
And I don't
want to see or hear

140
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,697
about you
anywhere near a car.

141
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,233
Here,
the bedroom is yours.

142
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,070
Make yourself comfortable.

143
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,176
Lights out in 10.

144
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,736
You got to be kiddin'.

145
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,536
Wrong train.

146
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,505
I'm new here.

147
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,308
Boswell, yes, ma'am.

148
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,372
Japanese food
is like the Army.

149
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,875
Don't ask, don't tell.

150
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,445
Name's Twinkie.

151
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,539
Hey, I noticed
you ain't have a laptop.

152
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,578
Yeah?

153
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,317
I'll hook you up.
Half price.

154
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,855
No, I'm cool.

155
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,415
60% off. Hmm?

156
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,552
Since we're both army
brats and everything.

157
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,154
I ain't got no cash,
man.

158
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,062
And I ain't
an army brat.

159
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,498
All right, all right.

160
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,160
Well, what about
a cell phone, huh?

161
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,332
Everybody needs
a cell phone.

162
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,971
No offense,

163
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,570
but I'm probably
not gonna be here

164
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,474
long enough
to remember your name.

165
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,581
Then you gonna need some new
shoes to book town with, man.

166
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,116
You like Michael Jordan?

167
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,717
I love Michael Jordan.

168
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,510
Check this out.

169
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,346
Brand new Jordans.
Not even out yet.

170
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,655
LeBron James couldn't even
get his hands on those.

171
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,854
You selling that
Sparco steering wheel?

172
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,366
Hell, no.
That's mine right there.

173
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,966
Man, I even paid
retail for it.

174
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:06,863
What you drive?

175
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,600
My ride?
Yeah.

176
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,301
My ride's one of a kind.

177
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,535
Show me.

178
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,702
Thought you
weren't stickin' around.

179
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,741
All right.

180
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,667
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

181
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:44,470
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

182
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,380
<i>Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

183
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:53,680
<i>My life be like
Ooh Aah, Ooh Ooh</i>

184
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,117
<i>My life be like</i>

185
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,587
<i>It's times like these
that make me say</i>

186
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,988
<i>Lord if you see me
please come my way</i>

187
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,458
<i>Leavin' bread crumbs
for when I stray</i>

188
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,859
<i>Rely on sacrifice
and the price you paid</i>

189
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,457
<i>Feel me like a fingertip</i>

190
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,798
Slamming, huh?
Look at that car.

191
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,633
<i>Tryin' not to quench your
fire with the things I do</i>

192
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,570
At least let me drive.

193
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,107
Y'all better have some
real cars around here.

194
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,235
Okay, I see
somebody got jokes, huh?

195
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,870
Well, all right.

196
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,881
I don't know if you're
ready for them, though.

197
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,974
You look a little nervous.

198
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,042
What up, Tosh?

199
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,763
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

200
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,243
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

201
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,243
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

202
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,306
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

203
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:02,513
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

204
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,919
For when you
blow your wad, man.

205
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,697
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

206
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,640
Hear that?

207
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,546
It's still not right
for the way I drive.

208
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,821
I don't need a computer to tell
me about my throttle response.

209
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,289
Okay.
Then we're done here.

210
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,759
You wouldn't have
that problem with a V8.

211
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,861
Boys.

212
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,265
All they care about is
who's got the biggest engine.

213
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:27,033
I'm a guy.
It's in my DNA.

214
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,203
So y'all race
with these things, huh?

215
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,639
Cute little toys.

216
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,010
You know, I almost didn't recognize
you without your slippers on.

217
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,982
<i>Don't you mean uwabaki?</i>

218
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,652
Neela, right?

219
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,321
You're a quick learner.

220
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,821
So, where you from,
anyway?

221
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,020
Here.

222
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:52,156
No, I mean,
not where you live.

223
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,857
Where'd you come from?

224
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,025
Does it really matter
where I'm from?

225
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,503
Who's the tourist?

226
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,445
What's with you
and the schoolgirls, D?

227
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,005
You're moving up
in the world.

228
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,744
You gotta
elevate your company.

229
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,480
Wednesday, Wednesday,
meet Thursday.

230
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,021
God. Girl.

231
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,022
Ladies, hold that thought, all right?

232
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,686
All right, beautiful.
Hold up.

233
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:25,752
Hey!

234
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,431
He was just leaving.

235
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,438
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Japanese.

236
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,946
<i>Understand that?
Gaijin?</i>

237
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,241
Takashi.

238
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,340
We were just talking.

239
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,282
This isn't your scene.

240
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:52,249
<i>That word you called me,
gaijin or something or other,</i>

241
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,985
what does that mean
exactly?

242
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,421
Means, turn around,

243
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,725
keep walking.

244
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,130
That's exactly
what we gonna do.

245
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,292
Come on, man,
let's roll.

246
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:04,835
<i>Yo, look, man,
he's yakuza.</i>

247
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,872
Now, see, that's funny,

248
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,999
'cause I thought this
was, like, a free country

249
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,778
where a girl could talk
to whoever she wants.

250
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,783
You know who I am,
boy?

251
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:24,316
Yeah. You're like the Justin
Timberlake of Japan, right?

252
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,321
Leave.

253
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,624
<i>Damn, man.
You know yakuza? The Mafia?</i>

254
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,392
<i>Look, sorry, DK- san.</i>

255
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,438
Monkey didn't have
his banana today.

256
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,301
Hey, D, let's go.

257
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,739
It's time to race.

258
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,744
Hey, good luck, Timberlake.

259
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:02,282
You're the one that's lucky,
'cause I'm about to race.

260
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,855
Then let's race.

261
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,694
With what, huh?
Your skateboard?

262
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,738
Easy to sound cocky
when you got no ride.

263
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,741
Take mine.

264
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,213
Let's race.

265
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,848
What? I wanna see
what the kid's got.

266
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,120
Can he drive?

267
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,699
Can he drive?

268
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,830
You know what DK
stands for?

269
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,205
Donkey Kong?

270
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,006
Drift King.

271
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,804
Drift?

272
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,747
What do you mean,
drift?

273
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,951
Still need
a dictionary?

274
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,523
You know that
real famous painting?

275
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,998
The one of the woman
who's smiling all the time?

276
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,056
<i>The Mona Lisa.</i>

277
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,261
Right, right, right.
Mona Lisa.

278
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,928
Well, look, man,
this car right here's

279
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,632
<i>like the Mona Lisa
of the drift world.</i>

280
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:24,536
Han rebuilt this bad boy
from ground up.

281
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,076
We talking forged pistons,

282
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:29,409
bigger turbo,
new rods, new crankshaft.

283
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,447
Hey, man, Han's labor
ain't cheap, man, you feel me?

284
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,751
Well, if I needed a 30-second
lesson on how to drift...

285
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,313
All right, look, man, there's lots
of ways you can do this, all right?

286
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,484
Hand braking
is the easiest,

287
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,617
so the first thing
I want you to do,

288
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:43,922
I want you
to rip that e-brake.

289
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,121
All right,
after you rip the e-brake,

290
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,993
then I want you
to power over.

291
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,994
You know what?

292
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,592
Just don't mess up Mona,
all right?

293
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,401
All right.

294
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,518
Ready.

295
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,019
Set.

296
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:54,956
Go!

297
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,105
I told you.

298
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,175
Damn it!

299
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,124
Damn it!

300
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,393
Don't leave town.

301
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,244
Do you know
what time it is?

302
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,581
I thought
it was around 7:00.

303
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,951
You know,
US is a few hours behind.

304
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,796
Looks like the party
was better here, anyway.

305
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,760
Have you been racing, Sean?

306
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,569
You're out of here.

307
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,340
Go ahead.

308
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,643
You don't get it,
do you?

309
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,843
You have
nowhere else to go.

310
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,583
If it doesn't
work out here,

311
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,678
you're going to jail.
Do you get that?

312
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,626
This isn't a game.

313
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,323
And I'm gonna tell you
one more time,

314
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,058
if you're gonna
live under my roof,

315
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,033
you're gonna go by
my rules or get out.

316
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,200
Understand?

317
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,929
Understand?

318
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,102
Yes, sir.

319
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,987
Get in.

320
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,595
I'll get you your money.

321
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,826
Why you talking
like you have a choice?

322
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,072
There's a guy in there
with a paw

323
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,945
that owes me some money.

324
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,176
A paw?

325
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,482
Go get me my money.

326
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,655
Okay.

327
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,811
Han said,

328
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,950
<i>okane.</i>

329
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,550
<i>Han said, okane.</i>

330
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,787
Let's go.

331
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,826
You're in the pickup
and delivery business now.

332
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,497
I might call you once a week
or once an hour.

333
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,130
I don't care
if you're sick as a dog

334
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,902
or in bed with Beyoncé.

335
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:26,603
I call, you show.

336
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,543
Only if you teach me
how to drift.

337
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,545
This ain't a negotiation.

338
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,746
I wasn't negotiating.

339
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,030
What's he doing here?

340
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,126
He's paying me back for
that crumpled beer can

341
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,068
sitting in my garage.

342
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,004
Hope
he's not driving.

343
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,304
<i>Gaijin.</i>

344
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,207
When is your next race?

345
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,009
I'd really like to be there.

346
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,017
Why not be in it?

347
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,658
You heard me.

348
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,891
Ready to lose
another car, Han?

349
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,493
I'm ready to take that
'86 Corolla off your hands.

350
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,732
All right.

351
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,970
Put up the '72 Skyline.

352
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,198
Done.

353
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:07,369
What do you think,
Morimoto, huh?

354
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,578
Get him out of here.

355
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,511
We have business
to discuss.

356
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:27,394
Your shipment's late.

357
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,593
Since when are you
so worried about the details?

358
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,961
When is
the shipment arriving, Han?

359
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,068
Just sit pretty
and let me handle it.

360
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,726
Hey, Dad, it's me.

361
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,193
Uh, I had to
stay after school

362
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,133
for some
extracurricular activities.

363
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,134
So I'll be home
a little later.

364
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:12,900
Sir.

365
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,214
You really need to stop
following me around.

366
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,283
What are you
doing here?

367
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,485
I thought I'd stop by
and ask your boyfriend

368
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,043
for some drifting lessons.

369
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,349
Trust me.

370
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,221
You don't wanna be
a part of this world.

371
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,622
It's good enough for you.

372
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,685
You don't know
anything about me.

373
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,061
Well, why don't you
think I know?

374
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,532
<i>'Cause I'm a gaijin?
An outsider?</i>

375
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,637
Let me guess.

376
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,834
You're an army brat
who moved around a lot.

377
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,399
Your mama and daddy
was never home.

378
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,446
So you walked around
pissed off all the time.

379
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,846
And now you found your family
with these drift nuts.

380
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,351
Zero for one, cowboy.

381
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,126
Why can't you go find
a nice Japanese girl

382
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,864
like the rest of
the white guys around here?

383
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,734
<i>Mamacita, oh my God,
I think your on fire</i>

384
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,776
<i>Do you want me
to get you water</i>

385
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,108
Is everything okay
back there?

386
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,472
I can handle DK.

387
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,314
<i>I thought he's yakuza.</i>

388
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,714
<i>His uncle's yakuza.</i>

389
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:34,190
He's just playing gangster
in his little storage room.

390
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,619
But I need him.

391
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:42,560
He keeps Uncle Kamata
from poking around too much.

392
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,728
What do you mean?

393
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,670
Well, his uncle gets
a piece of the action

394
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,365
from everyone
on his turf.

395
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,101
We're on his turf.

396
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,004
50% of something
is better than

397
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,739
100% of nothing.

398
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,913
So have you raced DK?

399
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,778
Why not? Is he that good?

400
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,380
What's the point
of a race?

401
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,891
To see if I'm better
than the other guy.

402
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,984
Just proves you're faster,
that's all.

403
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,528
If I were to race,
it would have to be

404
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,496
for something important.

405
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,556
Or why else do it at all?

406
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,837
Why are you
letting me race?

407
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:23,135
'Cause you're
DK's kryptonite.

408
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,439
And you owe me a car.

409
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:34,107
<i>She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down</i>

410
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,554
<i>She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton</i>

411
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,659
<i>She wanna break it down, break it
down, break it down, break it down</i>

412
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,057
<i>She want some reggaeton,
reggaeton, reggaeton, reggaeton</i>

413
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,225
Oh, shit.

414
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,828
<i>I make ya smile right</i>

415
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,935
What the...

416
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,603
Police cars here are
only factory-tuned.

417
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,169
You can do
better than 180 k,

418
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,545
they can't catch you,
so they don't even try.

419
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,244
<i>'Cause its just nice you lookin
different sayin' to yourself</i>

420
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,843
You know what?

421
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,785
I'm beginning to like
this country already.

422
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,187
<i>When my chain keep linkin'
like Christmas lights</i>

423
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,624
<i>Mamacita, oh my God
I think your on fire</i>

424
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,495
<i>Do you want me
to get you water</i>

425
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,931
Danny!

426
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,636
You're looking good.

427
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:35,972
Disco.

428
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,148
We gotta catch up.

429
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,711
Get you a drink on me, huh?

430
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,051
Let's go.

431
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:03,306
Aha. Easy now, ladies.

432
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,504
Come on.

433
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:11,207
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy,
hey Mami, you sexy</i>

434
00:44:11,281 --> 00:44:13,647
What's up?
How you doing?

435
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,048
Hey, baby.

436
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,952
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy,

00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,013
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy</i>

438
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,421
<i>Can I get that number</i>

439
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,153
<i>Big hot pockets,
feya, ugly</i>

440
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:25,286
<i>Corny, busted,
chopped, straight fugly</i>

441
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,023
<i>British guys playing rugby</i>

<i>Brooklyn boys

<i>Skanky, cranky,

<i>Slammin dudes

<i>G'Doonk G'Doonk,

Keep your hands
off the kid, girls.

447
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,829
He's underage.

448
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:38,898
<i>Country boys and them boys

Ladies, ladies, ladies.

450
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,873
Disneyland
for grownups, huh?

451
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,379
All these girls, man,
they look like...

452
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:45,847
What, models?

453
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:46,974
Check it out.

454
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,814
See,
Tokyo is the fashion capital

455
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,251
on this side of the planet,
all right?

456
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,753
Now, imagine
you been posing all day.

457
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,221
I mean,
that's a lot of hard work.

458
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,882
Not only do you get tired,
but, on top of that,

459
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:56,448
you wanna have a little fun,
but you can't

460
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,518
'cause you don't even know
nobody in town.

461
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,028
And most of
the guys around here are

462
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,826
too chicken shit
to even try picking up one.

463
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,560
So what do you do?

464
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,665
Man, you talk to the little
dude who makes you laugh.

465
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:08,830
Yeah.

466
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,867
Look, man, I don't just think
outside the box.

467
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,466
I tear it up.

468
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,136
That's my thing.

469
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,268
Yo.

470
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,945
<i>You should
slow it down papi</i>

471
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,815
<i>You sound like

472
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,445
Sean!

473
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,681
<i>But you're
just plain sloppy</i>

474
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:30,188
<i>Hey Mami, you sexy</i>

475
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,391
<i>It's dipset Bitch</i>

00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,737
<i>There you go

478
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,333
<i>And I'm thinkin' about
gettin' at her</i>

479
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,969
<i>Okay,
time to whistle at her</i>

480
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:53,983
<i>Ay girl,

481
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,780
<i>There it go
Bring it here baby</i>

482
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,983
<i>There it go
Bring it here baby</i>

483
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,350
<i>Top down
and I'm at it again</i>

484
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,152
<i>It's hot now
and I'm at it to win</i>

485
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,523
<i>You heard me</i>

486
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,618
<i>Who want it with me</i>

487
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,754
<i>Nobody wanna it with me
Oh, I'm so fly</i>

488
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:07,922
<i>Oh, Mami, Back up</i>

489
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,397
<i>Move it till you feel
something hard on your back</i>

490
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,195
The red Evo's yours.

491
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,600
<i>If u want it come and get it
I ain't kiddin' I'm with it</i>

492
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,331
<i>Here it go, go</i>

493
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:20,240
<i>So, girl,
let me see you get low</i>

494
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,335
<i>There it go
Yeah, just like that</i>

495
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,840
What do you mean?

496
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:27,276
You're representing
me now.

497
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,876
What you think, I'm gonna
let you roll in a Hyundai?

498
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,723
<i>So, girl,
let me see you get low</i>

499
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,408
Oh, man.

500
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:03,942
Damn it.

501
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,619
My mother,
she's blind in one eye

502
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:13,526
and she can drift
better than that.

503
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,259
Han,
where did you find this guy?

504
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,199
Will someone please teach
this guy how to drift?

505
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,420
Is that yours?

506
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:49,694
Sure is.

507
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,536
What happened?

508
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,211
I don't know. I found
it this way at the base.

509
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,684
It's got potential.

510
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,922
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

511
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,530
You know, Sean,
the Japanese have a saying.

512
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,138
"The nail that sticks out
gets hammered. "

513
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,973
You're gonna be late.

514
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,750
Sean!

515
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,643
Come on, man, you broke it.

516
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:17,945
Hey, whoa, whoa.

517
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,150
There must be
a misunderstanding.

518
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,988
Out of my way,
or you're next.

519
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,120
Take it easy.

520
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,993
Look, man, I don't
do refunds, all right?

521
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:30,363
Okay, let's go, then!
Let's go!

522
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,100
Touch me again...

523
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:36,898
Here.

524
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,033
Try not to break
this one.

525
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:55,413
Say, man!

526
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,050
What the hell is
wrong with you, huh?

527
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:59,960
Now everybody's gonna want
exchanges around here.

528
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,122
Damn!

529
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,042
Not easy saving the day,
is it?

530
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,714
Maybe you could give me
some pointers sometime.

531
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,444
You're doing
all right.

532
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:23,746
Thanks.

533
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,315
Hey.

534
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,618
Yeah?

535
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,788
Sorry about the other night.

536
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,730
Your life isn't
any of my business.

537
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:39,700
It's okay.

538
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,117
Foul!

539
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,824
Ain't no damn foul.
That was a foul.

540
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,295
Yo, you in my face.
That was a foul.

541
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,889
Hey, Han,
sort this wanker out.

542
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,194
A wanker?

543
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,496
What do I look like,
a zebra?

544
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,770
So, how did you end up
over here, anyway?

545
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,314
Well, you know
those old Westerns

546
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,918
where the cowboys
make a run for the border?

547
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,284
This is my Mexico.

548
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,519
Why'd you let me
race with your car?

549
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:42,894
You knew
I was gonna wreck it.

550
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,728
Why not?

551
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,062
'Cause it's a lot of money.

552
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,638
I have money.

553
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,840
It's trust and character
I need around me.

554
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,571
You know, who you
choose to be around you

555
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,672
lets you know
who you are.

556
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,379
And one car in exchange
for knowing

557
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,182
what a man's made of,

558
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,920
that's a price
I can live with.

559
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,689
Look at all those
people down there.

560
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,697
They follow the rules,
for what?

561
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,267
They're letting
fear lead them.

562
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,299
What happens if they don't?

563
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,135
Life's simple.

564
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,742
You make choices
and you don't look back.

565
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,989
<i>So,
if you don't drift to win,</i>

566
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:49,031
<i>what do you drift for?</i>

567
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,727
<i>You really
want to know?</i>

568
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,129
<i>Yeah.</i>

569
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,493
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

570
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,440
<i>There's no "wax on,
wax off" with drifting.</i>

571
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,283
Learn by doin' it.

572
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,744
The first drifters
invented drifting

573
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,585
out here in the mountains
by feeling it.

574
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,090
So feel it.

575
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:36,799
Again!

576
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:40,369
What's in this bag?

577
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,002
You'll see.

578
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:43,945
How much you got?

579
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,447
Keep going, keep going.

580
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,181
I'm so good, man, I could
sell rubbers to a monk.

581
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,151
Again.

582
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,479
Again.

583
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,762
Watch it. Watch it.
Not too early, now.

584
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,471
Go, go, go, go!

585
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,718
Don't lose it! Don't lose it!

586
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:35,986
Hey, Han.

587
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,807
Hey, Twink.
Get this man a bunk.

588
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,344
Pleasure doing business.

589
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:15,180
Yeah, baby. I told you.
I told you, didn't I?

590
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,764
It's actually not bad.

591
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,800
I didn't even have
to put ketchup on it.

592
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,996
<i>See,
I'm not a total gaijin.</i>

593
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,296
I hate that word.

594
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,801
It's what they used
to call me when I was a kid.

595
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:11,507
I thought
you were born here.

596
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,675
Well, "outsider" can mean
many different things.

597
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:22,014
My mom died when I was 10.

598
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,020
She came out here
from Australia

599
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:26,755
when she
finished high school.

600
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,294
And all I know
about her is that

601
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,060
she went to work
in a hostess bar.

602
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,330
DK's grandmother took me in.

603
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,376
Well, my parents
split up when I was three.

604
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,343
Me and Mom
moved around a lot.

605
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,912
Mostly 'cause of me.

606
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,250
Well,
it was all 'cause of me.

607
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:55,657
Kind of made myself
an outsider, you know,

608
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,190
without even
thinking about it.

609
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:01,456
But I realize now,

610
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,931
outsider or insider,
it doesn't really matter.

611
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,195
All that matters is knowing
what you really want

612
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:10,901
and going after it.

613
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,825
We used to come up here
when we were kids.

614
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,630
Even before we could drive
we'd cut class, sneak out,

615
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,260
come up here, and watch
the older kids drift.

616
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,001
Things were different
back then.

617
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,882
Once I got my license,
I practically lived up here.

618
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,046
Back then, kids just drove
whatever they had.

619
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,484
You know, we just made do.

620
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:01,885
No one bothered us.

621
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,850
The day I got my license

622
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:07,418
is the day I got
my first speeding ticket.

623
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,897
The day after that,
I won my first race.

624
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,960
I beat this rich kid
by three lengths.

625
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,700
I gotta admit, it felt good.

626
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,805
It felt like...

627
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,306
Like everything else
just disappears.

628
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:25,803
No past and no future.

629
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,873
No problems.

630
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,444
Just the moment.

631
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,604
Boy needs to chill.

632
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,310
Hey, Twink,
I'm gonna grab another set.

633
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,648
Whoa! Whoa,
whoa, whoa! Another set?

634
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,514
No. Look, that was
your third set today.

635
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:08,614
I mean,
them tires ain't cheap.

636
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,163
DK, grab a chair.

637
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,032
We're about to
roast some marshmallows.

638
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,801
Yo, come on, man, look...

639
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,882
Stay away from her,

640
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,387
or the only thing you'll
be driving is a wheelchair.

641
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,228
Find yourself a new driver.

642
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,171
I'm all right.

643
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,774
What'd you expect?

644
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,647
You didn't just
play with fire,

645
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:09,480
you soaked
the matches in gasoline.

646
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,673
It's over.

647
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,023
<i>All this over a gaijin?</i>

648
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,758
<i>I am a gaijin.</i>

649
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,400
You've changed, DK.

650
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,575
You say I've changed.

651
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,543
But we're not so different,
you and I.

652
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,652
We're both products
of fuckups, aren't we?

653
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:28,926
They say your mom
was the best trick

654
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:31,523
in all of Kabukicho
back in the day.

655
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:33,695
Leave my mother
out of this.

656
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:37,170
If we hadn't taken you in,
you'd be just like her,

657
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,099
doing anything
for a buck.

658
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,973
Think anyone would take
a second look at you

659
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,512
if it wasn't
for your uncle?

660
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,693
We're the same, Neela.

661
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,763
Difference is I know who I am
and where I belong.

662
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,644
Do you know
who you are?

663
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:21,973
Do you know
where you belong?

664
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,295
Hey.

665
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:48,571
Come on.

666
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:34,798
Hey, brother.

667
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,101
I vouched for you!

668
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,141
Put my reputation
on the line for you!

669
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:40,606
We were partners!

670
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,877
You think you can keep
your side deals from me?

671
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:46,847
Come on.
We ain't in the Boy Scouts.

672
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:48,809
This is what we do.

673
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:50,111
Takashi!

674
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,420
What about now? Hmm?

675
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,692
Is this what we do?

676
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,860
Man, you need me.

677
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,932
You'd still be
shaking down teahouses

678
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,493
for chump change
if it wasn't for me.

679
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,541
Get in!

680
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:21,947
Go! Go! Go!

681
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:27,249
Come on.

682
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,289
Sean. Sean!

683
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:37,013
Takashi.

684
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,529
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

685
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,039
Okay.

686
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:02,648
I'll go with you.

687
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,311
Neela.

688
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,696
See you when
Daddy's not around.

689
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:42,417
I'm putting you
on a plane tonight.

690
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,549
Dad...

691
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,058
Sean, don't argue with me.

692
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,925
I did this.
I can't run away.

693
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,121
I can't.

694
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:51,825
Sean,
I'm your father.

695
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,834
I'm responsible
for your well-being.

696
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,461
And I'm responsible
for my mess.

697
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,405
I gotta do this.

698
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,580
Can you understand that?

699
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:24,360
At least you're not
redoing my mistakes.

700
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:54,824
You all right, man?

701
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,326
We're leaving town.

702
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,628
Look, I know some people...

703
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,936
I can't do it, Twink.

704
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,969
Look, DK wants your head.

705
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,177
All right?

706
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:14,673
And the trouble you
just made for Kamata?

707
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:17,943
You're done here, bro.

708
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,081
Maybe I should
talk to Kamata.

709
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:23,951
What?

710
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,087
DK answers to him.

711
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:31,162
I know I just
didn't hear that.

712
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:36,569
I gotta end this.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

713
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:38,629
What, are you crazy, huh?

714
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,432
Han is dead, all right!

715
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:43,501
Plus, you can't just walk
into Kamata's place, man!

716
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,172
It's all I got.

717
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:57,953
Something I think Han
would've wanted you to have.

718
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:13,940
What's this?

719
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,768
You're gonna need it
if you're gonna make it

720
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:19,073
out of Kamata's place
alive.

721
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:24,745
Don't you need it?

722
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,946
No, it's cool.
Look, I'll figure it out.

723
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:40,953
Sean.

724
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,328
You need to leave.

725
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:49,796
You came to the wrong place.

726
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:52,201
I didn't come here
to see you.

727
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:53,835
Takashi.

728
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,732
You think

729
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:29,334
you can walk in here,
dump some cash and walk out?

730
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:33,379
I know I'm only returning
what belonged to you

731
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,416
in the first place, sir.

732
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:39,213
But that's not
why I really came.

733
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,912
I came here
to apologize.

734
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,788
I know your nephew and I have
embarrassed ourselves badly.

735
01:22:59,774 --> 01:23:03,540
Sir, I'm here to offer you
a peaceful solution.

736
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,649
How do you plan
to accomplish that?

737
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,245
A race.

738
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:19,392
DK and I have caused
nothing but problems for you,

739
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:21,061
for us.

740
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,662
And I'm asking you
to allow us to settle this,

741
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,758
once and for all.

742
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,363
We race

743
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:33,232
and the loser leaves town
for good.

744
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:36,141
I've already beat
this piece of shit once!

745
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:37,403
Good.

746
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,814
Then it should be easy.

747
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,147
The cops
took all the cars.

748
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:22,714
Hey!

749
01:25:39,534 --> 01:25:41,229
That's why she's spitting.

750
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:06,087
We almost there, Twink.

751
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:07,922
Couple more tweaks.

752
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:11,830
It's not the car
I'm worried about, man.

753
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:15,202
DK picked this road
for a reason.

754
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:17,298
This is his mountain.

755
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,334
He's the only one to ever
make it to the bottom.

756
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:17,470
Yeah!

757
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:25,477
Yeah!

758
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:26,645
Yes!

759
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:25,903
Come on.

760
01:31:37,124 --> 01:31:38,386
Yeah! Come on!

761
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:39,687
Come on, Sean.

762
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:41,089
Let's go! Let's go!

763
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,062
Sean, you the boss. Let's go.

764
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:13,489
Damn! Come on, man!
That ain't right.

765
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:24,546
Yeah, baby!

766
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:25,785
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

767
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,225
I told you!

768
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:14,732
<i>I wonder if you know
How they live in Tokyo</i>

769
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:18,472
<i>If you see me then you mean
it Then you know you have to go</i>

770
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,741
<i>Fast and furious</i>

771
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,339
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

772
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:24,748
<i>Fast and furious</i>

773
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:26,753
<i>Tick, Tick, Tick</i>

774
01:35:31,826 --> 01:35:33,919
Hey, yo, Sean!
Yo, Sean!

775
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:36,323
Hey, check this out, man.

776
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:39,463
This dude over here
wanna race the new DK.

777
01:35:40,434 --> 01:35:43,267
Heard he's been beating
everybody around Asia, too.

778
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:45,168
Not tonight, Twinkie.

779
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:50,269
Said he knew Han.

780
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:58,647
Said Han was family.

781
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:13,997
All right.

782
01:36:14,401 --> 01:36:15,493
Let's race.

783
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:44,061
Nice ride.

784
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:47,524
I won it from my friend Han,
a few years ago.

785
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:52,299
I didn't know he was
into American muscle.

786
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:54,864
He was when
he was rolling with me.

787
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:59,946
You know this ain't
no 10-second race.

788
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:02,314
I got nothing but time.

789
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:07,444
You ready, kid?

790
01:37:18,332 --> 01:37:19,993
Come on, Sean! Come on!

791
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:23,196
Ready!

792
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:27,365
Set!

793
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:32,839
Go!

794
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:36,858
<i>You so crazy,

795
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:39,421
<i>Far East to West Mic Check</i>

01:40:50,577 --> 01:40:51,703

01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:55,647
<i>So hot so hard

<i>You so crazy,

01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:04,657
<i>So hot so hard

01:41:04,758 --> 01:41:08,885
<i>You so crazy,

802
01:41:54,741 --> 01:41:57,835
<i>We got big jewels,

<i>Big watch
